Executive Summary 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex (CCMC) comprises two adjacent copper operations 
producing copper concentrates from open pit and underground mines located near Copiapó in the 
Atacama Region, Region III of Chile: Compañia Contra ctual Minera Candelaria  (Minera Candelaria 
or Candelaria) and Compañia Contractual Minera Ojos del Salado (Minera Ojos del Salado or Ojos del Salado). Minera Candelaria is an open pit and underground mine providing copper ore to an on-
site concentrator with a capacity of 75,000 tonnes per day. Minera Ojos del Salado comprises two 
underground mines, Santos and Alcaparrosa. The Sa ntos mine provides copper ore to an on-site 
concentrator with a capacity of 3,700 tonnes  per day and 1,400 tonnes per day to the Minera 
Candelaria mill, while all ore from the Alcaparros a mine is treated at the Minera Candelaria mill. 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is indirectly owned by Lundin Mining Corporation (LMC or the Company) (80%) and Sumitomo Metals Mining Co ., Ltd. and Sumitomo Corporation (collectively, 
Sumitomo) (20%). For clarity, references to "Candel aria Copper Mining Complex" or "CCMC" in this 
Technical Report refer to both the Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado properties. 
 
Lundin Mining Corporation is a diversified Canadian base metals mining company with operations 
and projects in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Portugal , Sweden, and the United States of America, 
primarily producing copper, zinc, gold and nickel. LMC is a Canadian public company with its head 
office in Toronto, Canada and its common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol 
LUN) and the NASDAQ Stockholm (symbol LUMI).  
In June 2022, LMC retained the services of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (SRK) to visit the 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex and to compile this Technical Teport pursuant to National 
Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mine ral Projects and Form 43-101F1. This Technical 
Report updates the November 28, 2018, Techni cal Report entitled "Technical Report for the 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex,  Atacama Region, Region III, Chile".  It summarizes the technical 
information that is relevant to support the di sclosure of the updated Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves estimates (as of December 31, 2022) contained herein prepared using revised economic 
parameters and the positive results of recent exploration programs. 
 
Since acquiring Freeport-McMoRan Inc.'s 80% interest in the CCMC in November 2014, LMC has 
actively grown the annual reported Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves by a combination of 
factors. Although this growth was primarily driven by exploration success,  other factors including 
Mineral Resource modelling optimizations, operational efficiencies and innovation and the reduction 
of reporting cut-off grades also contributed to th is growth. Although drilling exploration expenditure 
targeting Mineral Resource expansion has decreased in recent years, with reported Mineral Resources and Reserves having plateaued, LMC has managed to comfortably replace depleted 
Mineral Reserves on an annual basis. CCMC expl oration staff will continue to define and upgrade 
underground and open pit Mineral Resource estimates on the property but will also turn their 
attention to evaluate the considerable exploration po tential in areas external to the current mine plan. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 This Technical Report also summarizes changes to the open pit phase design and new underground 
production schedules, based on these updated Mi neral Reserves, as well as operational 
improvement initiatives designed to reduce operational costs and improve efficiencies. 
 
Property Description, Location and Access 
 The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is in Chile's Atacama Region, Region III, approximately 
20 kilometres south of the city of Copiapó and adjac ent to the community of Tierra Amarilla all of 
which are approximately 650 kilometres north of S antiago (Figure i and Figure ii). The properties are 
easily accessed using the public road system. Copiapó is a modern city with all the regular services 
and a population of approximately 170,000. Personnel employed by  the Candelaria Copper Mining 
Complex are primarily from the Atacama region. Th e Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines receive 
electrical power through long-term  contracts with AES Andes S.A., a nation-wide energy company.  
 
The primary water supply comes from a desalination plant, which was commissioned in 2013 and is 
located at the Punta Padrones port facility at t he nearby seaport of Caldera. Both the desalination 
plant and the Punta Padrones port are owned by Minera Candelaria. The copper concentrate is 
trucked from site to local customers or sh ipped from Punta Padrones to world markets.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 Copiapó has a desert climate with mild temperatur es year-round. Winters are mild with warm 
temperatures. Annual precipitation averages approxim ately 17 millimetres, the majority of which falls 
in the winter months. The elevation of the mini ng operations does not exceed 800 metres above sea 
level. The climate and relatively low elevation al low for year-round mining and exploration activities. 
 
The Minera Candelaria property comprises inside Candelaria District 220 mining exploitation 
concessions (approximately 6,094 he ctares) and 29 mining explorati on concessions (approximately 
6,680 hectares) (Figure 2 and Appendix A) and outsi de Candelaria District 51 mining exploitation 
concessions (approximately 5,966 he ctares) and 11 mining explorati on concessions (approximately 
1,300 hectares). The tenements are free of mortgag es, encumbrances, prohibitions, injunctions, and 
litigation. The tenements containing the active and future mining activities are not affected by 
royalties. The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex holds certain surface and underground water use 
rights and certain surface water use rights, all free of mortgages, encumbrances, prohibitions, 
injunctions, and litigation. 
 
There are no known factors or risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work 
on the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex.  
History 
 The Candelaria sulphide deposit was discovered by  Phelps Dodge Corporation (Phelps Dodge) in 
1987. A feasibility study was completed in 1990, and,  following approval by the Chilean government, 
construction started in October of 1992. Sumitomo  acquired a 20% stake in the property in 1992. 
Production commenced in early 1995. In 1997, P helps Dodge completed the expansion of the 
concentrator throughout with the installation of a second semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill, 
additional mining facilities and new and expanded concentrator facilities. 
 Mine site and district exploration programs have been active since the discovery of the Candelaria 
deposit. This work resulted in the discovery of the Alcaparrosa, Candelaria Underground (both North 
and South Sectors), and Española deposits. Both sectors in Candelaria Underground are now in 
active production. 
 
In 2007, property ownership changed when Freeport- McMoRan Inc. (Freeport) acquired Phelps 
Dodge.  
During 2011, a pipeline was completed to bring water purchased from a nearby sewage treatment 
facility to the Candelaria mine. A desalinati on plant at the port of Caldera was built and 
commissioned in 2013 at a capacity of 500 litres per second. 
 
The Santos underground mine has been in production since 1929, with processing taking place at 
what is now called the Pedro Aguirre Cerda (PAC) plant. Phelps Dodge became sole owner of 
Minera Ojos del Salado and the Santos mine and PAC plant in 1985. The PAC plant has been 
expanded several times to its current capacity of 3,800 tonnes per day. Sumitomo acquired its 20% 
interest in Minera Ojos del Salado in 2005. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page vii 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 In early 1996, production from the Alcaparrosa underground mine commenced. Due to low copper 
prices the PAC plant was shut down from 1998 to 2004. 
In November 2014, LMC acquired Freeport's interest in the CCMC. 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex has been a significant producer of copper since the mid-
1990s. Between 2017 and 2021, annual contained copper and gold metals in concentrates have 
averaged approximately 143 kilotonnes and 84 kilo ounces, respectively. 
 
During 2015, the Candelaria 2030 project received environmental approval. Key permits were 
received during 2016 for t he construction of the new  Los Diques tailings stor age facility and major 
civil works began in August 2016 and construction continued through 2017. 
 
During 2017 permits were granted to allow the Candelaria Underground operations to expand 
production from 6,000 to 14,000 tonnes per day. 
 
In 2018, the new Los Diques tailings management facility was commissioned and received its first 
tailings. In addition, initial Mineral Resources a nd Mineral Reserves were declared for the recent 
Española surface discovery. 
 
In 2019, the Candelaria Underground S outh Sector started production. 
 
In 2020, LMC submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 2040 documentations to the 
authority to extend Candelaria's life of mine (LOM) and to execute various infrastructure projects 
included under the EIA. The review process is ongoing and will continue in 2023. 
 
Geology, Mineralization, and Deposit Types 
 
Regional, Local, and Property Geology 
 
The Candelaria sulphide deposit is located at t he boundary between the Coastal Cordillera and the 
Copiapó Precordillera. The Coastal Cordillera of Chañaral and Copiapó is composed of Permian to Lower Cretaceous intrusions within a basement  of metasedimentary rocks of Devonian to 
Carboniferous age. Volcanic, volcaniclastic, and ma rine carbonate rocks represent intra- and back-
arc sequences that were deposited during Early to Mid-Cretaceous.   The Candelaria, Santos and Alcaparrosa mines and the Española deposit are located in the district 
of Punta del Cobre. The polymetallic sulphide deposi ts are hosted in volcanic rocks of the Punta del 
Cobre Formation. Polymetallic sulphide deposits in the Punta del Cobre district are located to the 
east of the main branches of the Atacama fault z one, a subduction-linked, strike-slip fault system 
stretching over 1,000 kilometres along the Chilean coast and active at least since the Jurassic. The dominant structural elements of t he Punta del Cobre area are the no rtheast-trending Tierra Amarilla 
Anticlinorium, a southeast-verging fold-and-thrust  system and a series of north-northwest- to 
northwest-trending high-angle faults. 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page viii 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 Calcareous, sedimentary, and volcaniclastic rock of the Abundancia and Punta del Cobre formations 
are exposed within the open pit of the Candelaria mine. The lowermost unit in the Candelaria mine and Candelaria Underground is the Lower Andesite, a compact succession of porphyritic to massive 
andesite and volcaniclastic breccias with intense biotite-quartz-magnetite-albite alteration. The 
Santos mine is located in the eastern limb of the north-northeast-trending Tierra Amarilla anticline, 
and the rocks of the Santos mine are comprised mainly of the Punta del Cobre and Abundancia 
Formations. The Alcaparrosa mine is located in the northern part of the Punta del Cobre mining 
district, with the Punta del Cobre Formation subdivided into a Lower Andesite unit, which is succeeded by volcanoclastic breccias, albitophyre and pyroxene- scapolite hornfels interbedded with 
garnetites. The Española deposit is in the south portion of Candelaria-Punta del Cobre district, and 
occurs in the contact aureole between the Copiapó batholith and sedimentary and volcano-
sedimentary rocks of the Chañarc illo Group and the Punta del Cobre Formation in a tectonically 
depressed block controlled by San Gregorio fault system.  Mineralization  The copper-gold sulphide mineralization found at  the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is 
generally referred to as iron oxide copper gold (IOCG) mineralization. The sulphide mineralization occurs in breccias, stockwork veinlets, disseminatio ns in andesite, and as an internal tuff unit. There 
are also some localized controls to mineralization in  the form of faults, breccias, veins, and foliation. 
Candelaria has become an exploration model for Andean-type IOCG deposits that display close relationships to the plutonic complexes and broadly coeval fault systems. Depending on lithology 
and the structural setting, the polymetallic sulphide mineralization can occur as  veins, hydrothermal 
breccias, replacement mantos, and calcic skarns. The Candelaria IOCG system lies within the 
thermal aureole of the Lower Cretaceous magmat ic arc plutonic suite in the Candelaria-Punta del 
Cobre district.  The main mineralized body at the Candelaria mine is up to 400 metres thick in its central part and 
thins towards the edges. In east-west sections , the mineralization has a lenticular, downward 
concave shape with a steep eastern limb and a shallowly dipping western limb. The shape of the mineralized body in north-south sect ion is irregular. In plan view, the extent of the mineralization in 
Candelaria is approximately 1,400 metres by 2,400 metres. The mineralized body was folded after its formation. The north-northeast-trending fold ax is corresponds to the Tierra Amarilla Anticline. 
 In the Santos mine, three styles of mineralizatio n are observed: veins, mantos, and breccia bodies. 
An important vein in the Santos Mine is the Isabel  Vein, which has a northwest striking orientation, 
and extends over 1 kilometre in length and between 4 and 30 metres in width. Manto-type 
mineralization occurs as tabular bodies located at  two sedimentary horizons located in the floor and 
roof of the albitophyre. The manto mineralization is characterized by variable iron contents with 
magnetite common in the north and deeper areas, and specular hematite in the south. Mineralization 
occurs within breccia bodies, which are typically contained with the albitophyre and lower andesite 
units and the mineralization generally forms steeply west-dipping and north-northwest- to northwest-
striking bodies. 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page ix 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 Mineralization at the Alcaparrosa mine principally occurs as mantos that trend to the northeast and 
dip to the west. Ore mineralogy consists of chalco pyrite, pyrite, and magnetite, with trace pyrrhotite, 
molybdenite, and arsenopyrite. Mineralization at t he Alcaparrosa mine also occurs as veinlets 
defining dense stockwork, breccias as well as fi ne dissemination in biotite meta-andesites. High-
grade bodies are also found in massive vein s striking north-northwest, north, and east. 
 In the Española project area, mineralization occurs  within mantos hosted mainly in a brown garnet 
skarn, and in lesser proportions within silica ho rnfels. Chalcopyrite is the primary copper sulfide 
mineral found as clusters and in disseminated form, commonly associated with brown garnet 
porphyroblasts. Near the surface and down to a dept h of approximately 70 m, the mineralization is 
oxidized, characterized by the presence of chrysocolla, malachite, native copper, diogenite and 
bornite. 
 
Deposit Types 
 The copper-gold sulphide mineralization present at the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is 
generally referred to as iron oxide copper gold (IOCG). Depending on lithology and the structural setting, the polymetallic sulphide mineralization can occur as veins, hydrothermal breccias, 
replacement mantos, and calcic skarns.  The Candelaria IOCG deposit lies within the me tamorphic aureole of the Lower Cretaceous 
magmatic arc plutonic complex that is located within the Candelaria-Punta del Cobre district, 
Atacama Region, northern Chile. IOCG deposits are primarily defined by their elevated magnetite 
and / or hematite with elevated copper and gold contents.  
Exploration 
 
Ongoing exploration is conducted by the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex with the primary 
purpose of supporting mining and increasing the esti mated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
available for mining. Exploration is focused on the known mantos, veins, and breccia masses in 
proximity to existing open pit and underground infras tructure. Historically, this strategy has proven 
very effective in defining new Mineral Resources available for underground mining. Much of the 
exploration is conducted from underground, requ iring significant underground development to 
provide adequate drilling stat ions. Regional explorat ion is also undertaken on the large properties 
surrounding the mines to identify targets and defi ne new areas with Mineral Resource potential. 
 
From 2010 to the end of June 2022, Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado have together 
invested more than US$267M in exploration to ex pand the Mineral Resources primarily below the 
Candelaria Open Pit, to the north and south of the pit, and at the three underground mines (Candelaria Underground, Santos and Alcaparrosa) . During this period, 3,780 core boreholes 
(1,051,068 metres) were drilled requiring over 15,000 metres of underground development to 
provide access for drilling. 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page x 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 In 2015, a new exploration and resource devel opment tool, Mineral Inventory Range Analysis 
(MIRA), was initiated with the purpose to understan d the potential mineral inventory remaining in the 
mines as well as within the Candelaria land hol dings. Brownfield explorat ion drilling began late in 
2017 with surface drilling commencing in the south di strict of the Candelaria land concession in an 
area called Española. A new Mineral Resource mode l was constructed with this data to support 
Mineral Resource estimation. The Mineral Reso urce model was updated again in 2019, following 
additional drilling of 8,027 metres in 34 boreholes that was carried out in 2019.The recent aggressive 
exploration program has resulted in significant new discoveries with a positive impact particularly on 
the life of the three underground mines. 
 Building on this exploration success, future expl oration for the period 2023 to 2027 will focus on 
maintaining operational fronts in the mines, target ing the lateral extensions of the areas investigated 
since 2010 and exploring district targets to the nor th and south of mining infrastructure within the 
Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado land holdings. The planned exploration program 
includes approximately 1,160 metres of underground development, 171,500 metres of core drilling, 
and continued geophysical campaigns at a tota l estimated combined cost of US$48.0M. 
 The exploration potential of the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex remains excellent. The qualified 
person is of the opinion that continued exploratio n programs and the MIRA exploration and Mineral 
Resource development initiative will continue to expand the underground Mineral Resource 
estimates. 
 
Drilling 
 
Mineral Resources are estimated from information obtained from surface and underground boreholes. From 1990 to June 30, 2022, 4,689 core  and percussion boreholes (1,361,873 metres) 
were drilled in and around the Candelaria mine. A pproximately 96% of all drilling comprised core 
boreholes. 
 
From 1990 to 2004, there were five exploration diamond drill holes drilled in Española totaling 
2,861 metres. No exploration wo rk occurred between 2005 and 2016. From July 2017 to the end of 
June 2022, 154 new diamond drill holes were completed totaling 44,952 metres. To date, Española 
has 159 drill holes with 47,813 metres in total. In the Santos mine, a total 1,604 core boreholes 
(323,591 metres) were drilled from underground and surface stations from 1988 until June 30, 2022. 
The borehole data base for the Alcaparrosa mine contains 1,165 boreholes (283,133 metres) drilled 
from surface and underground locations from 1990 to June 30, 2022. 
 
The drilling and sampling procedures  are consistent with general ly recognized industry best 
practices. The qualified person concludes that the samples are representative of the source 
materials and there is no evidence that the sampling process introduced a bias. 
 
Sampling, Analysis, a nd Data Verification 
 
Analytical samples informing the Candelaria Mineral Resource estimates were prepared and 
assayed at the Candelaria mine laboratory that is  accredited to ISO17025 for the analyses of copper, CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xi 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 iron, zinc, and silver. The laboratory is not i ndependent from Minera Candelaria and is managed by 
the Candelaria Processing Department. Intertek and Geolaqium in the Paipote Sector of Copiapó, 
Chile have been used as umpire laboratories, which are independent of Minera Candelaria. 
 
Analytical samples informing the Ojos del Salado Mineral Resource estimates were prepared and 
assayed by Intertek (formerly Vigalab). Intertek is a global group operating 13 laboratories in Chile 
with a management system accredited to ISO9001.  Intertek's laboratories are independent from 
Minera Ojos del Salado. Since 2016, the Can delaria laboratory has been used as an umpire 
laboratory. 
 The sample analyses used for the Mineral Resource reporting for the Española project were 
prepared by Geolaquim Ltda. (Geolaquim) (80%) and Intertek l (20%). Geolaquim is certified under 
regulation ISO 17025 by the INN for concentrated minerals and others (soluble copper, total copper, 
iron and gold). 
 
The sample preparation and analytical methodologies used for assaying Candelaria, Ojos del Salado 
and Española samples are similar. Upon reception,  sample details are recorded and insertion points 
for quality control samples in the sample stream are determined. Sample preparation includes drying 
at 105 degrees Celsius in a forced air furnace, primary crushing to 100% passing 5 millimetres, and 
secondary crushing cycle to 90% passing 1.68 millimetres (12 mesh).  Grinding tests are conducted 
on every 40th sample. From the crushed material  two 1-kilogram samples are prepared using a 
rotary splitter. Both samples are pulverized separately to 95% passing 0.106 millimetres (140 mesh), 
and further subdivided into subsamples, including th ose used for quality control and those kept for 
future reference or as backup should more sample material be required. 
 
Conventional preparation and assaying procedures were used. Copper is analyzed by multi acid digestion and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Go ld is assayed using a fire assay procedure. 
Specific gravity is systematically measured every 2 metres over the full sample interval. Assay data 
are loaded directly from digital assay result files into the final database in order to minimize entry 
errors. 
 
All drilling assay samples are collected by a cont ractor under the direct supervision of a mine 
geologist. Samples from Candelaria are processed at the mine site. Samples from Ojos del Salado are shipped directly from the property to the Intert ek laboratory in Paipote. In each case, established 
procedures were used to ensure the security of samples during transportation between the drill rig 
and the laboratories, including through maintaining the chain of custody of samples to prevent 
inadvertent contamination or mixing of samples and rendering active tampering as difficult as 
possible. 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex implements anal ytical quality control measures consistent 
with generally accepted industry best practices. T he analytical quality control program includes the 
use of control samples inserted with all sa mples submitted and check assaying by umpire 
laboratories. The analytical quality control data are routi nely monitored and audited. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xii 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 In the opinion of the authors of this Technical Re port, the analytical results delivered by the primary 
laboratories used are sufficiently reliable to inform Mineral Resource estimates. The sampling 
preparation, security, and analytic al procedures used are consistent  with generally accepted industry 
best practices and are therefore adequate to  support Mineral Resource estimation. 
 
Mineral Processing and Me tallurgical Testing 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex maintains regular metallurgical testing programs that are 
incorporated with historical testing results and m ill performance into statistical models to predict and 
improve processing performance for mill throughput, recovery and final concentrate grade. 
Metallurgical tests are generally conducted at specialized facilities such as the Universidad de Atacama and at commercial third-party laborator ies in Chile, including SGS Mineral Services. 
Metallurgical testing focuses on rock hardness, mi neralogy and bench scale flot ation tests to predict 
mill throughput and metallurgical performance. The internal test work conducted by Candelaria 
includes comminution and flotation testing for routine characterization and ongoing development of 
geometallurgical models. 
 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex maintains a copper recovery model, last updated in 2018. This model includes factors for geological units, stoc kpiled material and copper and zinc head grades. 
This model is updated regularly based on metallurg ical testing and operations data. The most 
important factors impacting recovery are copper grade, throughput and feed particle size. 
 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 The Mineral Resource estimates discussed herein ar e informed from core drilling information stored 
in a secured central database and were evaluat ed using a geostatistical block modelling approach. 
Six Mineral Resource models were prepared for the areas comprising the Candelaria Open Pit mine 
and Española open pit project and the four underground mines (Candelaria Underground North Sector, Candelaria Underground South Sector, S antos, and Alcaparrosa) using slightly different 
methodologies and assumptions. The block models co mprising the Candelaria Underground, Santos 
and Alcaparrosa underground deposits have been integrated since 2017. 
 
SRK reviewed and audited the Mineral Resource models prepared by Minera Candelaria and Minera 
Ojos del Salado personnel. In the opinion of the authors, the Mineral Resource estimation reported 
herein is a reasonable representation of the Miner al Resources found at the Candelaria Copper 
Mining Complex at the current level of sampling.  The Mineral Resources have been estimated in 
conformity with generally accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best 
Practices Guidelines  (November 29, 2019) and are reported in accordance with National Instrument 
43-101. The consolidated audited Mineral Resource  Statement for the Candelaria Copper Mining 
Complex, effective as of December 31, 2022, is  presented in Table i. Mineral Resources include 
Mineral Reserves. 
 
Since acquiring the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex in November 2014, the aggressive 
exploration programs undertaken by LMC has significantly expanded the Mineral Resource 
estimates of Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos de l Salado. Since the previous Mineral Resource CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xiii 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 model update in 2018, exploration continued in all the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado deposits and 
this led to an increase, in contained copper metal, of about 21% of the global Measured and 
Indicated Mineral Resources, compared to 2018 update. Other factors driving this increase include 
lowering of the reporting cut-off grades. In 2022, the La Española Open Pit cut-off grade was 
reduced from 0.20 to 0.17% copper, and for the underground Mineral Resources, the cut-off grade 
was lowered from 0.55% to 0.40% copper for the Candelaria and from 0.55% to 0.45% copper for 
the Ojos del Salado. The increase in the Indicated Mineral Resource for the Candelaria Underground 
(North and South sectors) contributes bulk of t he (about 90%) increase in copper metal in 2022. 
 
Open pit and underground Mineral Resource models (long-term models) for each deposit are compared to their respective grade control models (s hort term models) and to the production reports 
(as mined) on a monthly basis. Generally, the comparison between the long and short-term models 
is reasonable, but some significant differences  do occur that should be analysed by CCMC staff. 
These reconciliations have been undertaken for copper, gold and silver.

Mining Methods 
 The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex will operate with an overall mining rate of approximately 
205,000 tonnes per day over the next 23 years including an average of 76,800 tonnes per day of ore 
sent to the processing plants together with subs tantial quantities of ore recovered from the WIP CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xv 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 stockpiles. The average grade of the ore that will be mined from the open pits over the remaining 
LOM is estimated at 0.43% copper, while stockpil ed work-in-progress material  is estimated to have 
an average grade of 0.28% copper. The mine curren tly operates five electric shovels, 55 haulage 
trucks, seven production drills, and a fleet of support equipment. A major open pit mine equipment 
re-capitalization program will see 14 trucks and one shovel replaced  over the next three years. 
The Candelaria Underground mine is forecasting a combined production of 14,000 ore tonnes per 
day, approximately 10,000 tonnes and 4,000 tonnes fr om the North and South se ctors, respectively. 
The combined production from bot h sectors will allow the mine to ma intain this peak  production up 
until 2046. The average LOM grade is 0.78% copper. The Santos mine will continue to produce at its 
current rate of production of 5,500 tonnes per day of ore to 2026 then decrease to 3,800 tonnes per day of ore from 2027-2033 with an average LOM gra de of 0.88% copper. The mining method used in 
both underground mines is sublevel open stoping. 
 
Production from the Alcaparrosa mine is currently suspended due to a sinkhole incident which 
occurred in late 2022. Mineralized materials from  the mine have been excluded from the LOM plan 
and Mineral Reserves documented in this report. C andelaria is executing a workplan to remediate 
the sinkhole and return the Alcaparrosa mine to se rvice. The project scope broadly involves the 
filling of the sinkhole, stabilizing the stopes, m anaging water infiltration and sealing the aquifer 
permeation, and expelling excess water accumu lated in the mine, and managing stakeholder 
relations, legal processes and permit applications . The project is approved by LMC and includes a 
budget of $22.5M. Depending on permit timelines and subject to a favorable response from the 
authorities, the Alcaparrosa mine may return to serv ices within three years.  The Company will work 
with the authorities and various experts to evalua te and ensure that re-opening of the mine is 
feasible and that this can be executed safely. 
 
The LOM plan for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is largely driven by supplying ore to the Candelaria processing plant from the Candelaria and Española open pits although higher grade 
underground sources are of increasing importance. Surface WIP stockpiles are fed to the plant once 
the open pit Mineral Reserves have been depleted. The work-in-progress stockpile Proven and 
Probable Mineral Reserves are estimated at 78 m illion tonnes at an average grade of 0.28% copper, 
0.09 gram of gold per tonne, and 1.47 grams per tonne silver. 
 
The Candelaria open pit was designed to be mined in several phases of development. Based on the December 2022 LOM, four phases of development remain in the LOM plan (Phases 10 to 13). The 
overall strip ratio is expected to be 2.09:1 including ore that is initially delivered to stockpiles. The 
total in-pit waste is 753.6 million tonnes and the overall life of the open pit mine is 19 years. 
Candelaria has been planning a substantial mine equipment recapitalization program to replace the 
aged mining equipment fleet and a change in the loading methodology to increase capacity and 
efficiency while improving equipment availability and reliability. 
 
For La Española open pit, the total in -pit waste is 138.9 million tonnes and the overall life estimated 
at 13 years.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The three underground mines (Candelaria Underground North/South sectors, Santos and 
Alcaparrosa) utilize a sublevel stoping mining meth od for ore extraction. Th is method is ideal for 
relatively large, vertical, as well as thick deposi ts with favorable and stable host rock. Stopes can 
typically be up to 180 metres high with sublevels at 20 to 60 metre intervals. The length of the stopes 
is generally 40 to 100 metres with widths vary ing between 20 to 30 metres. Stopes are drilled down 
from the sublevel drilling drifts as benches using 114 to 130 millimetres diameter bit down-the-hole 
holes. The holes are loaded and blasted in vertical slices towards an open face created by the slot 
blasting. The blasted ore gravitates to the bottom of  the stope and is collected in draw points at the 
production level below. This lower level also cons ists of the haulage (transport) drift. The undercut 
levels, which feed the draw points, are 15 to 20 metres high and inclined at 50 to 60 degrees to allow the blasted ore to flow easily by gravity. An Ep iroc Simba tophammer rig drills 64 millimetres upholes 
within the undercut, which are loaded and blasted with the downholes. Once the stope is mined, a 
remaining rib pillar, which can be another 20 to 30 metres wide, may be blasted into the stope to 
increase the extraction tonnage. Typically, a 20-me tre structural pillar remains between each stope 
and no backfill is used at these operations. Muck ed ore is dumped into 60 tonne underground trucks 
(owned by Candelaria) and 30 or 40 tonne highway type trucks (owned by contractors) and hauled 
up the ramp to a surface stockpile for subsequent re-handling and processing. 
 
The current life of the Candelaria Underground and Santos mines is 24 and 12 years, respectively. 
 
For 2022, the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex produced contained metals in concentrate (100% 
basis) of 152 kilotonnes of copper, 86 kilo ounce s of gold and 1.6 million ounces of silver. Over the 
remaining LOM plan (to 2046), the average annual contained metal production is estimated to be 
123 kilotonnes of copper, 73 kilo-ounces of gold and 1.2 million ounces of silver. This is an 
improvement over those metrics reported in 2018 Te chnical Report in terms total contained copper 
metals and the overall project economics. Over the 10-year period from 2023 to 2032, the average 
annual production is estimated to be 151 kilotonnes of copper, 87 kilo-ounces of gold and 1.4 million 
ounces of silver. 
 
Recovery Methods 
 Candelaria Copper Mining Complex operates two processing plants: Candelaria and Pedro Aguirre 
Cerda (PAC). The Candelaria processing pl ant receives ore from the Candelaria open pit, 
Candelaria underground North and South Sector and part of Santos underground mines and has a 
nameplate capacity of 75,000 tonnes per day. The PA C processing plant receives ore exclusively 
from the Santos underground mine and has a design capacity of 3,800 tonnes per day. 
 
The annual throughput of Minera Candelaria from 20 05 to late 2022 averaged 26 Mtpa, equivalent to 
70,800 tonnes per day at a plant utilization of 92%. The average process plant recoveries for copper, 
gold and silver during this period were 93%, 72% and 83% respectively. Copper head grades are 
forecast to be between 0.5% to 0.7% until 2035 befor e falling to below 0.4% at the end of mine life. 
Reclaimed stockpiles and Candelaria Underground will be the only mill feed source at the end of 
mine life. 
 
In 2020, CCMC initiated the Candelaria Mill Optimization Project (CMOP) phase 3, also called 
debottlenecking project, to increase concentrator throughput by an expected 2,000 tonnes per day. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xvii 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 This project scope include d conversion of the existing ball mill N°6 to rod milling, will allow all the 
crushed and milled pebbles to advance towards se condary grinding, liberating room for incremental 
fresh feed to SAG milling. The project is expected to be completed in September 2023. 
 
The PAC concentrator of Minera Ojos del Salado has been in operation since 1929. The 
concentrator processes 3,800 tonnes per day of fresh feed from the Santos underground mine with 
an average head grade of 0.85% copper achieving a reco very of 94%. Final flotation tailings from the 
PAC plant are pumped to a new line to Los Diques, installed in 2019. 
 
Copper concentrates are trucked to the port at Punta Padrones, near Caldera. Concentrate grade 
has averaged 30% copper since 2019. Candelaria  produces a clean concentrate containing no 
penalty elements, with payable gold and silver . Gold content in the concentrate has been 
consistently 5 to 6 g/t with silver between 80 to  100 g/t. Zinc grades in the concentrate since 2019 
averaged 0.6%, which is below penalty levels. Fo r the PAC processing plant, copper concentrate 
has averaged 30% copper, 5 g/t gold, and 67 g/t silver since 2004. Gold and silver recoveries are 
slightly lower than Candelaria, at 72% each. 
 Minera Candelaria has an agreement with a third- party company to process Candelaria's flotation 
tailings and produce a magnetite concentrate as an additional source of by-product revenue. 
 
Project Infrastructure 
 The Minera Candelaria infrastructure includes: 
 
 Candelaria Open Pit and underground with a c apacity of approximately 202,000 tonnes of 
rock per day over the next 23 years. 
 Surface waste dumps located to the north and southwest of the Candelaria and La Española 
Open Pit. 
 Candelaria processing plant with a capacity of 70,000 – 77,000 tonnes per day. A series of 
process improvements (on going) have been scheduled for 2023 and 2024. 
 Candelaria Underground (North and South Sector ) with a current production ore capacity of 
14,000 tonnes per day. 
 The active Los Diques tailings storage facilit y located to the south-east of the open pit and

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The Minera Ojos del Salado infrastructure includes: 
 
 Alcaparrosa underground mine. The mine is cu rrently being suspended. Historically, the 
mine had an ore capacity of 4,400 tonnes per day and, if approved to re-start the production, 
is expected to sustain the same level of throughput in the future. 
 Santos underground mine with an or e capacity of 5,100 tonnes per day. 
 PAC processing plant with a capacity of 3,800 tonnes per day. 
 The closed Ojos del Salado tailings storage facilities. 
 Ancillary surface service buildings and road accesses. 
 
Market Studies 
 
The quality of the product produced at Candelaria / Ojos is marketable worldwide. The low level of 
elements detrimental to copper smelting and refining  makes the concentrate a valued quality for the 
feed mix for many smelters. The concentrate is shipped to the Far East (Japan, South Korea and 
China) and Europe.  
The copper concentrate production is predominantly sold under long term contracts directly to 
smelters and some traders. On a yearly basis , up to 15% of the annual copper concentrate 
production is sold on a spot basis through a tender process allowing for some production 
fluctuations. 
 
Franco-Nevada (Barbados) Corpor ation owns a gold and silver stream on production from the 
Candelaria operation. The stream covers 68% of  the payable gold and silver from 100% of the mine 
which reduces to 40% after 720,000 ounces of gold and 12 million ounces of silver have been delivered to Corporation (Franco-Nevada). As of December 31, 2022 CCMC has delivered 484.koz 
of gold and 7.8Moz of silver. Based on the 2023 LO M production estimates, the change from 68% to 
40% of production is expected to occur in year 2027. 
 
In addition to copper concentrate sales, there is an agreement with Compañía Minera del Pacifico 
S.A. (CMP) to process Candelaria's flotation tailin gs to produce a magnetite concentrate and this 
process creates an additional so urce of by-product revenue. 
 
Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is located at approximately 450 metres above sea level in 
the southern margins of the Atacama Desert, sout h of the major regional center of Copiapó and a 
few kilometres from the community  of Tierra Amarilla. The Punta P adrones facilities are located 
adjacent to the coastal community of Caldera, approximately 110 kilometres from the mine and mill. 
The arid climate and proximity to communities and ag ricultural areas and fishing zones constitute the 
major environmental and social constraints on project development and mine operation. 
Chile has in place a comprehensive regulatory framework for mining and other industrial activities, dating from the mid-1990s and most recently up dated in 2013. Although the Candelaria Copper 
Mining Complex was permitted and developed prior to the modern framework being in place, it holds 
numerous environmental approvals stemming from modifications to the original developments. In CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xix 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 addition, the complex holds more than 1,000 permits  for construction and operation of the mining 
and milling facilities, and related infrastructure. 
The most recently completed major environmental permitting effort was the "Candelaria 2030" EIA 
which included, among other things, an extension to  the mine life and the development of the Los 
Diques tailings storage facility. T he SEA (Environmental Assessment Service) approved the EIA via 
RCA No. 133/ in July 2015. Construction of the initia l phases of Los Diques tailings storage facility is 
now complete and the facility is operational. 
 
The EIA 2040 is in process of review by the SEA. The EIA documents were s ubmitted for approval in 
February 2020 and have gone through various stages  of consultations with the Chilean authority. 
Approval of the new EIA is expected in late 2023 or early 2024 and has been used as the basis of 
the 2023 LOM plan. The new EIA will allow CCMC to continue its operations to 2040. 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex im plemented the updated standard ISO 14001/2015 for 
Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado. An external audit was performed in January 2021 
and the certification with the updated standard was granted for three years. 
 The CCMC's operations currently have two poten tially significant open legal cases with the 
Environmental Superintendent (Superintendencia de Medio Ambiente, or SMA): 
 
 Case Blasting: In July 2021, the SMA notified Minera Candelaria of six charges to 
Candelaria RCAs. The SMA consider three of these charges to be serious with a potential 
fine of up to 5,000 annual tax units (US$2.2M) for each charge. 
 Case Sinkhole: As a result of the sinkhol e that occurred on Minera Ojos del Salado's 
property in July 2022, the SMA notified t he Company of four charges for non-compliance 
with the RCA. According to the SMA, thes e charges can lead to fines up to $15M. The 
Company is considering its options and strategi es for addressing the infraction notice. In 
addition to the SMA infractions, the National Geology and Mining Service ( Servicio Nacional 
de Geología y Minería , or SERNAGEOMIN) requested the temporary stoppage of the 
Alcaparrosa mine and Water Directorate (Dirección General de Agua, DGA) has imposed a 
fine to Compañia Contractual Minera Ojos del Salado of about US$140K (maximum fine) 
stating that the operation of t he Alcaparrosa mine has caused the perforation of the Copiapó 
aquifer causing permanent damage. The Company expects additional regulatory, 
administrative (CDE) and civil/constitutional clai ms (Tierra Amarilla, local residents, other 
aquifer users, etc.) are likely to be forthcom ing in the months / years ahead. Further, the 
Company anticipates that it will be required to remediate the damage to the aquifer and, 
eventually, fill the sinkhole. 
 
CCMC is actively working to strengthen trust with Tierra Amarilla and local and regional authorities 
through extensive engagement and transparent communications, following the sinkhole. In 
November 2022, the Company launched the Integrat ed Plan for the Alcaparrosa Mine, outlining six 
focus areas to address the environmental and so cial impacts generated by the sinkhole. 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex has social initiatives mainly focused on the communities 
nearest to its mines and port site, namely Tierra Amarilla, Copiapó and Caldera. Following Lundin CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xx 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 Mining Standards, CCMC has implemented a fo rmal Stakeholder Engagement Plan, a Social 
Investment Strategy, and a Grievance / suggestions mechanism. The Company operates community 
liaison offices in Tierra Amarilla, Copiapó and Caldera. 
Based on the LMC's Responsible Mining Manag ement System (RMMS) and its associated Social 
Performance Standards, the Company has developed a consistent and holistic five-year Corporate 
Social Performance Strategy an chored on strengthening internal skills and co mpetencies, enhancing 
data-driven decision making, integrating social pe rformance into enterprise-wide strategy and 
advancing development of social initiatives and targets. 
 
In 2022, CCMC updated its Annual Social Performance Plan, focuses on enhancing impact mitigation efforts through more extensive an d proactive engagement and the expansion of 
participatory monitoring activities that build capaci ty and awareness in the community. The plan also 
prioritized reigniting direct collaboration with nei ghborhoods and community organizations mainly in 
Tierra Amarilla and Caldera to plan and execute community investment projects. 
 
Capital and Operating Costs 
  The average open pit mining cost over the next five years, excluding capitaliz ed waste stripping, is 
forecasted to be US$2.50 per tonne of material mo ved. Costs have increased from the previous 
forecast due to higher inflation and additional mining equipment leasing in 2023 and 2024. 
 
The average underground mining cost over the nex t five years at Candelaria Underground is 
estimated to be US$16.05 per tonne, with overall costs falling as development requirements 
decrease in the last year of operations. Contractor  costs account for 44% of the total mining costs. 
The forecast average Ojos del Salado unit undergr ound mining cost over the next five years is 
estimated at approximately US$2 2.10 per tonne. The mine life at Santos has been extended to 
2034.  
The forecast average unit processing cost for Minera Candelaria over the next five years is 
estimated to be US$5.05 per tonne, decreasing from US$5.60 in 2023 to US$4.79 in 2027 as a 
newly negotiated electricity rate takes effect. 
 
The average processing cost for Minera Ojos del Salado over the next four years is estimated to be 
US$10.67 per tonne. This is a combination of the co sts for treating the Santos ore at the PAC plant 
and a small amount of Santos ore at the Candelaria plant. 
 
Minera Candelaria unit general and administrative cost  (G&A) over the next five years is estimated to 
be US$2.19 per tonne. For Minera Ojos del Salado, the average unit G&A cost over the next five 
years is expected to be US$4.04 per tonne which t he increase is mainly driven by suspension of 
Alcaparrosa mine. 
 
At Minera Candelaria, total capital expenditures over the period 2023 to 2027, excluding capitalized 
waste stripping, are forecasted at US$732M and at Minera Ojos del Salado the forecast for the next 
five years is US$61M, totaling a combined cost of US$793M. In the Candelaria Open Pit, the 
replacement program that commenced in 2018 c ontinues (new trucks, shovels and ancillary CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page xxi 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 equipment), of which approximately $154M is expect ed to be spent in the next five years. Capital 
costs for the Candelaria Underground mine have incr eased over previous forecasts and represent 
the development and supporting mine infrastructure for the expanded production of Candelaria North 
Sector and South Sector of the mine. The foreca st capital expenditure for Candelaria Underground 
over the next five years is US$238M. Candelaria m ill capital costs are forecasted at US$71M over 
the next five years, forecast estimated for upgra de items such as CMOP Phase 3, Power System 
Upgrade SAG, courier replacement, mill monitoring  systems, ball mill crown pinion replacement, 
transformers and building major repairs. 
 
During the production phase of the Candelaria Open  Pit mine, waste stripping costs which provide 
probable future economic benefits and improved acce ss to the orebody are capitalized to mineral 
properties. LMC capitalizes waste stripping cost s when experienced strip ratios are above the 
average planned strip ratio for each open pit phase under development. Capitalized waste stripping 
from the Candelaria open pit and the Española open pit project is forecasted to be US$578M for the 
period 2023 to 2027 and US$1,066M over the life of mine. 
 
Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is a significant  class, long-life, copper mining operation. In 
2023, the complex is expected to produce contain ed metal in concentrate (100% basis) of 145-
155 kilotonnes of copper and 85-90 kilo ounces of  gold. Based on the December 31, 2022, Mineral 
Reserves, the projects are expected to support operations until 2046. 
 
Aggressive ongoing Mineral Resource expansion exploration since acquisition may have the 
potential to extend the mine life beyond 2046 and to further change the projected copper production 
profile by replacing low grade open pit and deferring stockpile mill feed with higher grade ore 
extracted from the expanding underground mi nes and deferring deplet ion of the low-grade 
stockpiles. There are also opportunities to optimiz e the efficiency of the Candelaria plant through 
ongoing improvement initiatives currently under im plementation and modifications to the grinding 
circuits. Various ongoing onsite innovation / optimization initiatives with certain disciplines (including 
MIRA, CMOP, Candelaria South developmen t, mining equipment upgrades and various 
infrastructure upgrades) are progressing well, with  each having the potential to have a positive and 
material impact on operational efficiencies and to the life of mine.  
 Although currently experiencing re-organization with  several new team members recently joined the 
Company, technical information about the CCMC is extensive and attests to the overall high quality 
of the exploration, mine planning, and design wo rk completed by site personnel. Although Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve growth through expl oration success has decreased in recent years, 
operational efficiencies, a reduction in reporting cut-off grades, continued Mineral Resource model 
integrations and the incorporation of material  from the expanding Española open pit project have 
made significant contributions to mine growth. Based on the results from the audit, the qualified 
persons concludes that the Miner al Resource and Mineral Reserv e Statements for the CCMC as of 
December 31, 2022, are appropriately categorized and free of material errors. Financial information 
examined by the qualified persons confirms that the Mineral Reserves are economic under the 
assumptions considered. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

SRK Team   February 22, 2023  
The EIA 2040 is in process of review by the SEA. The EIA documents were s ubmitted to the SEIA in 
February 2020. The EIA, if approved, will allo w CCMC to continue its operations to 2040. 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex's future actions should be oriented towards addressing 
current SMA charges and to mitigate and compensate for the damage potentially caused by the 
sinkhole, prevent future related issues, and to regain the trust of the community and authorities. 
 
The qualified persons strongly recommends that LMC c ontinues its effective exploration strategy that 
has been very successful in increasing the Mine ral Resources and the Mineral Reserves of the 
CCMC. Combined with recent surface brownfield di scoveries, underground exploration continues to 
expand known sulphide bodies and yield new discov eries highlighting the exceptional exploration 
potential of the CCMC.

Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 1 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023  
1 Introduction and Terms of Reference 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex (CCMC) comprises two adjacent copper operations 
producing copper concentrates from open pit and underground mines located near Copiapó in the 
Atacama Region, Region III of Chile: Compañia Contra ctual Minera Candelaria  (Minera Candelaria 
or Candelaria) and Compañia Contractual Minera Ojos del Salado (Minera Ojos del Salado or Ojos 
del Salado). Minera Candelaria is an open pit and underground mine providing copper ore to an on-
site concentrator with a capacity of 75,000 tonnes per day. Minera Ojos del Salado comprises two underground mines, Santos and Alcaparrosa. The Sa ntos mine provides copper ore to an on-site 
concentrator with a capacity of 3,800 tonnes  per day and 1,400 tonnes per day to the Minera 
Candelaria mill, while all ore from the Alcaparros a mine is treated at the Minera Candelaria mill. 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is indirectly owned by Lundin Mining Corporation (LMC) 
(80%) and Sumitomo Metals Mining Co., Ltd. and Sumitomo Corporation (collectively, Sumitomo) 
(20%). For clarity, references to Candelaria C opper Mining Complex or CCMC in this Technical 
Report refer to both the Minera Candelar ia and Minera Ojos del Salado properties. 
 LMC is a diversified Canadian base metals mining company with operations and projects in 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and the United States of America, primarily producing 
copper, zinc, gold and nickel. LMC is a Canadian public company with its head office in Toronto, 
Canada and its common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol LUN) and the 
NASDAQ Stockholm (symbol LUMI). 
 
Since acquiring Freeport-McMoRan Inc.'s 80% interest in the CCMC in November 2014, LMC have actively grown the annual reported Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves by a combination of 
factors. Although this growth was primarily driven by exploration success,  other factors including 
Mineral Resource modelling optimizations, operational efficiencies and innovation and the reduction 
of reporting cut-off grades also contributed to th is growth. Although drilling exploration expenditure 
targeting Mineral Resource expansion has decreased in recent years, with reported Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves having plateaued, LMC has managed to comfortably replace 
depleted Mineral Reserves on an annual basis. CCMC exploration staff will continue to define and 
upgrade underground and open pit Mineral Resource estimates on the property but will also turn 
their attention to evaluate the cons iderable exploration potential in ar eas external to the current mine 
plan. 
 
In June 2022, LMC retained the services of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (SRK) to visit the 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex and to compile a new Technical Report pursuant to National 
Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mine ral Projects and Form 43-101F1. This Technical 
Report updates the November 28, 2018, Techni cal Report entitled "Technical Report for the 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex,  Atacama Region, Region III, Chile".  It summarizes the technical 
information that is relevant to support the disclosure of updated Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves estimates (as of December 31, 2022) prepared using revised economic parameters and 
the positive results of recent exploration progra ms. The report also summarizes changes to the open CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 2 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 pit phase design and new underground production schedules, which are integrated in the updated 
Mineral Reserves. Various operational improvement in itiatives are also described in this Technical 
Report. 
 
This Technical Report is based on an inspection of the properties by a team of qualified persons 
conducted on October 4 and 5, 2022, a review of technical information made available by LMC, and 
discussions with LMC technical personnel. The qualified persons have reviewed such technical 
information and determined it to be adequate to su pport Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
Statements pursuant to National Instrument 43-101. 
 
1.1 Terms of Reference 
 
The scope of work was defined in an engagement letter executed between LMC and SRK on 
June 24, 2022. The scope involves mobilizing a team of qualified persons to visit the subject mineral 
assets to review the technical information relevant to supporting Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves estimates prepared by Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado personnel. 
 
The objective of this review is to provide an independent opinion about the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves of the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex as of December 31, 2022 , and to 
compile a Technical Report pursuant to National In strument 43-101 to support the disclosure of 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Statements for the complex. 
 
1.2 Qualification of SRK 
 
The SRK Group comprises more than 1,400 professi onals, offering expertise in a wide range of

Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 5 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Often, but not always, forward-lo oking statements can be identified by the use of words such as 
"plans", "expects", or "does not ex pect", "is expected", " budget", "scheduled", "est imates", "forecasts", 
"intends", "anticipates", or "does not anticipate", or "believes", or variations of such words and 
phrases or state that certain acti ons, events or results "may", "cou ld", "would", "might" or "will" be 
taken, occur or be achieved. 
 
Forward-looking statements are based on the opini ons, estimates and assumptions of contributors to 
this Technical Report. Certain key assumptions are discussed in more detail. Forward looking 
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncert ainties and other factors which may cause the 
actual results, performance or achievements of LMC to be materially different from any other future 
results, performance or achiev ements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 
Such factors include, among others:  the actual results of current de velopment activities; conclusions 
of economic evaluations; changes in project par ameters as plans continue to be refined; future 
prices of copper, gold, silver and other metals; po ssible variations in ore grade or recovery rates; 
failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; accidents, labour disputes and 
other risks of the mining industry delays in obtai ning governmental approvals or financing or in the 
completion of development or construction activities; shortages of labour and materials, the impact 
on the supply chain and other complications associated with pandemics, including the COVID-19 
(coronavirus) pandemic; as well as those risk fact ors discussed or referred to in this Technical 
Report and in LMC's documents filed from time to ti me with the securities regulatory authorities in 
Canada. 
 There may be other factors than thos e identified that could cause actual  actions, events or results to 
differ materially from those described in forward-lo oking statements, there ma y be other factors that 
cause actions, events or results not to be antic ipated, estimated or intended. There can be no 
assurance that forward-looking statements will pr ove to be accurate, as actual results and future 
events could differ materially from those anticipat ed in such statements. Accordingly, readers are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-lo oking statements. Unless required by securities 
laws, the authors undertake no obligation to update th e forward-looking statements if circumstances 
or opinions should change. 
 
1.5.2 Non-GAAP Measures

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 3.2 Water Use Rights 
 
Minera Candelaria is the owner of underground wa ter use rights of consumptive and permanent use 
for approximately 1,046 litres per second. The underground water use rights are legally registered in 
the name of Minera Candelaria, free of mortgages,  encumbrances, prohibitions, injunctions, and 
litigation. 
 
Minera Candelaria is the property owner of superf icial water use rights that are equivalent to 
approximately 47 litres per second. The superficial water use rights are legally registered in the 
name of Minera Candelaria, free of mortgages, encumbrances, prohibitions, injunctions and 
litigation.  
Minera Ojos del Salado is the property owner of underground water use rights of consumptive and 
permanent use for a total of 50 litres per second. The underground water use rights are legally 
registered in the name of Minera Ojos del Salado, free of mortgages, encumbrances, prohibitions, 
injunctions, and litigation. 
 
Minera Ojos del Salado is the property owner of  superficial water use rights in the Las Rojas 
Channel that are equivalent to approximately 3 litre s per second. The superficial water use rights are 
legally registered in the name of Minera Ojos  del Salado, free of mortgages, encumbrances, 
prohibitions, injunctions, and litigation. 
 
With the commissioning of a desalination plant loca ted at the Punta Padrone port site in early 2013, 
the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex ceased extracting process water from underground water 
sources in November 2013. The underground water rights remain active and are used for potable 
and emergency purposes only. 
 
3.3 Mineral Rights in Chile 
 
There are two types of mining concessions in Ch ile: exploration concessions and exploitation 
concessions.  
In accordance with the Chilean Mining Code, the ow ner of a mining concession can explore, exploit 
and benefit from all minerals within the boundarie s of the relevant conc essions, except for 
hydrocarbon and lithium, without additional administrative concessions or operation agreements. 
 
Every titleholder of a mining concession, whether exploitation or exploration, has the right to 
establish an occupation easement over the su rface properties required for the comfortable 
exploration or exploitation of its concession. If t he surface property owner does not voluntarily agree 
to the granting of the easement, the titleholder of the mining concession may request such easement 
before the Courts of Justice, which shall grant the same upon determination of due compensation for 
losses. 
 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 11 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 All mining exploration and exploitation concession applications are submitted to the Chilean court 
and granted through a court procedure. Once the cour t procedure is completed, the court issues a 
final ruling decision. If the decision is supportive of  the application, the ruling decision acts as the 
legal title of the concession, which is then register ed in the national mining registrar. The application 
to court decision process typically takes six to eight  months for an exploration concession and 12 to 
15 months for an exploitation concession. 
 The main characteristics of exploration and expl oitation concessions are described in the following 
subsections. 
 
3.3.1 Exploration Concessions 
 The titleholder of an exploration co ncession has the right to carry out all types of mining exploration 
activities within the area of the concession. Expl oration concessions can overlap or be granted over 
the same area of land; however, the rights gr anted by an exploration concession can only be 
exercised by the titleholder with the earliest dat ed exploration concession over a particular area. 
 For each exploration concession, the titleholder must pay an annual fee of approximately US$4 per 
hectare to the Chilean Treasury. Exploration concessi ons have a duration of four years. At the end of 
this period, they may be converted, totally or  partially, into exploitation concessions. 
 
A titleholder with the earliest dated exploration conc ession has a preferential right to an exploitation 
concession in the area covered by the exploration concession, over any third parties with a later 
dated exploration concession for that area or wi thout an exploration concession at all and must 
oppose any applications made by third parties for exploitation concessions within the area for the 
exploration concession to remain valid. 
 
3.3.2 Exploitation Concessions 
 
The titleholder of an exploitation concession is granted  the right to explore and exploit the minerals 
located within the area of the concession and to ta ke ownership of the minerals that are extracted. 
Exploitation concessions can overla p or be granted over the same area of land; however, the rights 
granted by an exploitation concession can only be exercised by the titleholder with the earliest dated 
exploitation concession over a particular area. 
 
Exploitation concessions are of indefinite duratio n and an annual fee is payable to the Chilean 
Treasury of approximately US$7 per hectare with activity and US$27 per hectare without activity.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure, and Physiography 
The CCMC properties are located in the Atac ama Region, Region III of northern Chile, at an 
elevation of approximately 650 metres above sea le vel and approximately 20 kilometres south of the 
city of Copiapó and 5 kilometres west of the town of Tierra Amarilla. 
 
4.1 Accessibility 
 
The CCMC properties are accessible by two maintained dirt roads, one coming through the Tierra 
Amarilla community and the other branching off of Route 5, the Pan-American Highway, a well-
maintained multi-lane highway. Copiapó regional airp ort is serviced by regional flights from Santiago 
and other destinations on a daily basis. The regional airport is located approximately midway between Copiapó in the south and Caldera in the north.  Copiapó itself is strategically located on the 
Pan-American Highway. 
 
4.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
Copiapó is a modern city with all regular services and a population of approximately 170,000. 
Numerous mining-related businesses are in the ci ty. Personnel employed by the Candelaria Copper 
Mining Complex come from the Copiapó region. The Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines receive 
electrical power through long-term  contracts with AES Andes S.A ., a local energy company. The 
main line to the Candelaria mine is rated at 220 k ilovolts at 745 amperes. Ojos del Salado is serviced 
by a 23-kilovolt line with 235 amperes. Previously, 100% of the power was generated from coal-fired 
power plants. Starting in January 2023, it is expect ed that 80% of power generation will come from 
photovoltaic source and only 20% fr om the coal-fired thermal power.  The current contract with AES 
Andes S.A. expires in December 2035. 
 
The mines' water supply comes from a desalinat ion plant (Figure 3B) owned by Minera Candelaria 
via a pipeline that were both completed in 2013, as well as from a nearby wastewater treatment 
facility. The commissioning of t he desalination plant has enabled t he mines to cease drawing ground 
water from the Copiapó aquifer, the historic source of  water, except in emergency situations and for 
potable water supply. Concentrate is being shi pped from the Company-owned Punta Padrones port 
facility at the port of Caldera (Figure 3B). The fa cility has a storage capacity of 45,000 wet metric 
tonnes and can handle ships with a capacity of up to 67,000 tonnes and a draft of 12.4 metres. The 
port has a total annual capacity of some 3.5 milli on wet metric tonnes, well in excess of current and 
planned production. The new tailings storage facility, Los Diques, to  the southwest of the open pit 
and plant sites has been designed to replace the Candelaria tailings storage facility. The Los Diques 
facility has an approximate designed capacity of 60 0 million tonnes, to a final crest elevation of 
873 metres above sea level. A Prefeasibility Study ha s recently been completed to increase the TSF 
capacity to approximately 710 million tonnes. This additional capacity will be sufficient to support the 
current projected mine life. Key mine infrastructure is shown in Figure 4. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 13 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 4.3 Climate 
 
Copiapó has a desert climate with mild temperatur es year-round. Winters are mild with warm 
temperatures; mid-winter maximums in July reac h approximately 20 degrees Celsius. Winter night-
time temperatures average approximately 7 degrees  Celsius. Summers are warm with a January 
average of 22 degrees Celsius. Annual precipitati on is approximately 17 millimetres, of which the 
majority falls in the winter months. Ex ploration and mining can occur year-round. 
 
4.4 Physiography 
 
The project area is mountainous with a relief varying between 200 and 1,000 metres above sea level 
(Figure 3A-D). Vegetation is minimal outside of inh abited valleys where irrigation is used to support 
vegetation that can withstand the desert environment. The mines are in an active seismic zone.

5 History 
Information about the exploration history of the Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado mines 
is scarce. Information presented in this se ction was extracted from public databases. 
 
The Candelaria deposit was discovered by the Phelps  Dodge Corporation (Phelps Dodge) in 1987. A 
feasibility study was completed in 1990, and construction started in October 1992. Production 
commenced in early 1995. In 1996, Phelps Dodge announced plans to expand the concentrator throughput with the installation of a second semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill. The expansion 
also included additional mining facilities and new and expanded concentrator facilities. This upgrade 
was completed in 1997. Sumitomo Corporation acquired a 20% stake in the property in 1992. 
 
Mine site and district exploration programs have b een active since the discovery of the Candelaria 
deposit. This work resulted in the discovery of the Alcaparrosa, Candelaria Underground (both North 
and South Sectors), and La Espanola deposits. Both sectors in Candelaria Underground are now in 
active production. 
 In 2007, property ownership changed when Freeport- McMoRan Inc. (Freeport) acquired Phelps 
Dodge. Operations at the Candelaria C opper Mining Complex continued uninterrupted. 
 
During 2011, a pipeline was completed to bri ng water purchased from a nearby wastewater 
treatment facility to the Candelaria mine. 
 
A desalination plant at the port of Caldera was co mmissioned in 2013 at a capacity of 500 litres per 
second. 
 
The Santos mine has been in production since 19 29. At that time, the operation was known as 
Planta Punta de Cobre and was owned by Caja de Crédito Minero (CACREMI). The plant started 
with an initial throughput capacity of 250 tonnes per day. It was later renamed the PAC plant. In 
1978, the PAC plant was acquired by private indivi duals from Empresa Nacional de Minería, legal 
successor to CACREMI. The Santos mine and Resguardo  claims were also acquired, which together 
formed Minera Ojos del Salado. The processing capacity was increased to 650 tonnes per day. 
Phelps Dodge acquired 10% of Minera Ojos del Salado in 1983 and became sole owner of the property in 1985. The PAC plant was expanded for a second time in 1988, increasing capacity to 
1,700 tonnes per day. Subsequent upgrades have in creased the plant capacity to the current 3,800 
tonnes per day. Sumitomo acquired its 20% interest in Minera Ojos del Salado in 2005. 
 
In 1995, construction of a second underground opera tion at the Alcaparrosa mine commenced, with 
production starting in early 1996. 
 In November 2014, LMC acquired Freeport's 80% interest in the Candelaria Copper Mining 
Complex.

6 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
 
6.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Candelaria deposit is in the Atacama Regi on, Region III in northern Chile, at the boundary 
between the Coastal Cordillera and the Copiapó Precordillera. The Coastal Cordillera of Chañaral 
and Copiapó is composed of Permian to Lower Cr etaceous intrusions within a basement of 
metasedimentary rocks of Devonian to Carboni ferous age (Dallmeyer et al., 1996). Volcanic, 
volcaniclastic, and marine carbonate rocks repres ent intra- and back-arc sequences that were 
deposited during Early to Mid-Cretaceous (Arévalo et al., 2006). 
 In the Copiapó Precordillera the oldest exposed rocks are Early Carboniferous in age and correlate 
with metasedimentary base ment rocks in the Coasta l Cordillera. They are overlain by Permian to 
Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Permian gr anitic plutonic complexes in the Precordillera 
are associated with extensive crustal melting and rifting. Volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the 
Punta del Cobre Formation, the Bandurrias Fo rmation, and marine carbonate rocks of the 
Chañarcillo Group are prominently exposed as a belt of calcareous, volcanic, and volcaniclastic 
rocks in the western Precordillera . They are overlain by the Cerr illos Formation of epiclastic to 
volcaniclastic rocks. At the base, the Cerrillo s Formation contains fluviatile sandstone and 
conglomerate, as well as freshwater limestone. Volc anic breccias and lava flows are more dominant 
higher in the sequence. 
 
The Candelaria-Punta del Cobre polymetallic sulphi de deposits are located to the east of the 
Atacama fault zone, which extends over 1,000 ki lometres along the Chilean coast. The Atacama 
fault zone is a subduction-linked ar c-parallel strike-slip fault system  that has been active at least 
since the Jurassic (Marschik and Fontboté, 2001). 
 
6.2 Local Geology 
 
The Candelaria, Santos, and Alcaparrosa mines and Española project are in the mining district of 
Punta del Cobre. The polymetallic sulphide deposits are hosted in the volcanic rocks of the Punta del 
Cobre Formation (Figure 5). The Punta del Cobre Formation is overlain by Cretaceous marine 
calcareous rocks of the Lower Cretac eous Chañarcillo Group. The Chañarcillo Grou p comprises, 
from the bottom up, the Abundancia, Nant oco, Totoralillo, and Pabellón Formations. 
 
In the north and northwest, the rocks of the Ch añarcillo Group are interlayered with continental 
volcano-sedimentary rocks of the B andurrias Formation, also of Lower Cretaceous age. The rocks of 
the Chañarcillo Group were deposit ed in the back-arc facies of a vo lcanic arc, which is represented 
by the rocks of the Bandurrias and Punta del Cobre formations. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 18 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Intrusive rocks of the Coastal Batholith are located ma inly to the west of the Punta del Cobre district 
(Figure 5) and are age dated at between 123 and 11 1 million years. The development of a contact 
aureole to this batholith affected, with decreasi ng intensity to the east, all the Lower Cretaceous 
rocks in the Punta del Cobre district. At the lati tude of the Candelaria mine, the Coastal Batholith 
forms a tabular multi-phase plutonic complex formed, from oldest to youngest, by the La Brea diorite, 
the San Gregorio monzodiorite, the tonalitic to gr anodioritic Los Lirios pluton, and the Ojancos and 
El Granate microgranite (Figure 5). The largest area is covered by the La Brea pluton.  
 
Figure 5: Regional Geology Setting Around the Candelaria, Alcaparrosa, and Santos Mines 
 
 The dominant structural elements in the Candel aria-Punta del Cobre area are a large northeast-
trending antiform (Tierra Amarilla Anticlinorium), a southeast verging fold-and-thrust system and a 
dense set of north-northwest to northwest-trending hi gh-angle sinistral transcurrent faults (Marschik 
and Fontbote, 2001). This fold is part of the Pai pote Fold and Thrust System comprising a set of 
north-northeast-trending folds and thrust sheets (Arévalo et al., 2006). One of the folds in the 
Candelaria mine area is the northeast-trending Tierra  Amarilla Anticline, which has affected all Lower 
Cretaceous sedimentary and volcanic rock. 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 19 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Northeast-striking reverse faults parallel to the Tier ra Amarilla Anticline are part of the Paipote fold 
and thrust belt. Mylonitic shear zones and cataclas tic rocks locally form the contact between the 
intrusive rocks and Early Cretaceous host rocks. Ductile deformation is recorded in the Ojancos, 
Candelaria, and Florida shear zone s. Both the Tierra Amarilla An ticline and the Ojancos-Florida 
Shear Zone are displaced by north-northwest-t rending brittle faults (Figure 5). The Lar, 
San Gregorio, and Ojancos Faults show sinistral st rike-slip displacement. The rocks located between 
the major north-northwest-striking f aults also appear displaced by shorter faults of northwest- to 
north-northwest-strike orientation. 
 
6.3 Property Geology 
 
6.3.1 Geology of the Candelaria Mine 
 Calcareous, sedimentary, and volcaniclastic rock of the Abundancia and Punta del Cobre formations 
are exposed within the open pit of the Candelaria mine. Due to the closer proximity to the Coastal 
Batholith, rocks in the open pit of the Candelaria mine show stronger metasomatism and 
metamorphism than in other sulphide deposits of the Punta del Cobre district (Figure 6). 
 
The lowermost unit in the Candelaria mine and Candelaria Underground is the Lower Andesite, a 
compact succession of porphyritic to massive a ndesite and volcaniclastic breccias with intense 
biotite-quartz-magnetite-albite alteration (Figure 7 and Figure 8). The Lower Andesite is overlain by a 
succession of stratified volcaniclastic rocks includi ng tuffs, which are further sub-divided by alteration 
and mineralisation into pink garnet skarn and magnet ite breccia. The Upper Andesite of the Punta de 
Cobre Formation consists of a homogenous su ccession of undifferentia ted volcaniclastic and 
andesitic rock. The biotite-bearing andesite exhibits  alteration varying from quartz-pyroxene hornfels 
to pyroxene-scapolite-garnet skarns. 
 
The Abundancia Formation of the Chañarcillo Group in the Candelaria mine consists of fine-grained biotite-, silica-, or clinopyroxene-bearing calc areous metasandstone and mudstone. The stratified 
rocks are cut by dacite and lamprophyre dikes. The hydrothermally altered dacite porphyry dikes and 
sills locally contain copper mineralization. The youngest rocks in the Candelaria mine are post-
mineralization lamprophyre dikes. 
 
At the Candelaria mine a low angle shear zone, locate d at the confluence of ductile to brittle high-
angle faults, marks synplutonic brittle-to-ductile  extensional deformation (Arévalo et al., 2006).

6.3.2 Geology of the Española Project 
 The Española project is in the south portion of C andelaria-Punta del Cobre district, 2.5 kilometres 
southwest from the Candelaria open pit (Figure 4Figure 5 and Figure 9Figure 5). It occurs in the 
contact aureole between the Copiapó batholith and se dimentary and volcano- sedimentary rocks of 
the Chañarcillo Group and the Punta del Cobre Fo rmation in a tectonically depressed block 
controlled by San Gregorio fault system (Figure 9). The copper mineralization (oxides, sulphides and 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 mixed) is hosted mainly in brown garnet skarn leve ls and in quartz hornfels in the upper part of the 
stratigraphic sequence (Abundancia Format ion) with mantos characteristics. 
The main lithological types on surface are assigned to the Abundancia Formation and were affected 
by different metamorphic processes during emplac ement of the Copiapó batholith. In the eastern 
portion of the area, there is a fault contact with t he volcanic and volcanoclasti c rocks of the Punta del 
Cobre Formation. 
 
 
Figure 9: Geological Setting of the Española Project  
 
 
6.3.3 Geology of the Santos Mine 
 The rocks of the Santos mine are comprised mainly of the Punta del Cobre and Abundancia 
Formations. A typical section showing the geolog y of the Santos mine is shown in Figure 10. 
 The lowermost rocks of the Punta del Cobre Format ion are porphyritic to aphanitic andesite of the 
Lower Andesite. The Lower Andesite is conformabl y overlain by dacitic domes hydrothermally 
altered to an albitic-pyritic assemblage that is overla in by a succession of volcaniclastic breccias with 
interbedded layers of siltstone and sandstone. The basal portion of this unit (locally termed 
albitoforo) hosts manto-type copper mineralizati on. Conformably overlying the breccias are fine 
grained clastic rocks and Upper Andesite basaltic andesite flows. Intercalations of lenticular 
limestone, polymict breccias, volcanic tuffs, sandstone and iron-rich chert also occur within the Upper Andesite. The overlying Abundancia Format ion comprises well stratified marine sedimentary 
rock, mainly calcareous sandstone. The rocks of the Abundancia Formation do not contain 
significant mineralization. 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 23 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Intrusive rocks in the Santos mine are represented by a hornblende diorite, which intrudes the Punta 
del Cobre Formation and the lower Abundancia Formati on. Dikes cut various stratigraphic levels of 
the Punta del Cobre Formation and some layers of the Abundancia Formation. Andesitic dikes trend 
northwest and are up to 4 metres thick. Dacitic di kes occur in variable orientations ranging from 
northwest to northeast trends and are up to 5 me tres thick. Dikes post-d ate the mineralization. 
 
The Santos mine is located in the eastern limb of the north-nor theast-trending Tierra Amarilla 
anticline. The stratigraphic contacts in the eastern  limb of the fold dip approximately 25 degrees to 
the east. 
 
 
Figure 10: Geological Setting of the Santos Mine 
 
 
6.3.4 Geology of the Alcaparrosa Mine 
 
The Alcaparrosa mine is located in the northern part  of the Punta del Cobre mining district (Figure 5), 
in the west flank of Copiapó valley. A typical sect ion of the mine stratigraphy is shown in Figure 11. 
Punta del Cobre Formation is subdivided into a Lower Andesite unit, which is succeeded by 
volcanoclastic breccias, albitophyre and pyroxene - scapolite hornfels interbedded with garnetites. 
The Lower Andesite consist of aphanitic, porphyrit ic, blastoporphyritic and brecciated dark grey 
andesites. The albitophyre is a light grey porphyrit ic dacite with phenocrysts of plagioclase and 
occasionally "quartz eyes" in an aphanitic silica groundmass. The volcanoclastic breccia contains 
porphyritic rock clasts altered to potassic felds par in a matrix with high contents of magnetite. 
Hornfels and garnetites are concordant locate d over the albitophyre and correspond to the

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 metamorphosed equivalents of the upper part of  Punta de Cobre Formation and Abundancia 
Formation. In the southern central part of t he mine a granodiorite stock cu ts the whole sequence. 
The metasedimentary unit overlying the Punta del Cobre Formation likely corresponds to the 
Abundancia Formation. The metasedimentary unit is divided into the following two sub-units: a 
quartz hornfels, and a pyroxene-scapolite-garnet skarn with metasomatic banding. 
 
Intrusive rocks are andesitic, graniti c, dioritic and monzodioritic dike s, and a diorite st ock. The diorite 
stock is a post-mineral intrusion with equigranul ar texture composed of plagioclase and hornblende 
phenocrysts. The diorite st ock is cut by dikes. Andesite dike s are porphyritic in texture and do not 
contain any mineralization. Graniti c dikes have aplitic to porphyri tic texture and show disseminated 
traces of pyrite and magnetite, although they do not contain any copper mineralization. Dioritic dikes 
are fine-grained equi-granular and barren. Monzodi oritic dikes contain xenoliths of magnetite and 
chalcopyrite veinlets.

6.4 Mineralization 
 
6.4.1 Mineralization at the Candelaria Mine 
 The main mineralized body at the Candelaria mi ne is hosted in rocks of the Punta del Cobre 
Formation. Specifically, the host rocks are mass ive andesite and andesite breccias of the Lower 
Andesite, and volcanic tuffs and volcaniclastic rock s comprising the base of the Upper Andesite. In 
the metasedimentary rock unit, t he mineralization is confined to a few isolated layers (mantos). 
 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 25 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 The mineralized body is up to 400 metres thick in it s central part and thins towards the edges. In 
east-west sections, the mineralization has a l enticular, downward concave shape with a steep 
eastern limb and a moderately steep dipping wester n limb. The shape of the mineralized body in 
north-south section is irregular. In plan view, t he extent of the mineralization is approximately 
1,400 metres by 2,400 metres. The mineralized bod y was folded after its formation. The north-
northeast-trending fold axis corresponds  to the Tierra Amarilla Anticline. 
 The mineralization assemblage in the Candelaria mine  consists of chalcopyrite, magnetite, pyrite, 
pyrrhotite, and sphalerite. Biotite, calc-silicate minerals, and potassium feldspar constitute the 
gangue minerals. Pervasive potassic alteration is associated with the mineralization. 
 
Dominant copper mineralization styles are mantos , veins, breccia bodies, and veinlets along foliation 
planes. Gold occurs within chalcopyrite grains an d along fractures surface in pyrite. Chalcopyrite and 
pyrite also occur in secondary northwest and north-northwest-striking faults.  
6.4.2 Mineralization at  the Española Project 
 
In the Española project area, the primary dominant copper sulphide is chalcopyrite found as clusters 
and in disseminated form commonly associated with  brown garnet porphyroblasts. Gangue minerals 
are pyrite and iron oxides (magnetite-hematite). Near the surface and down to a depth of 
approximately 70, the mineralization is oxidized, characterized by the presence of chrysocolla, 
malachite, native copper, diogenite and bornite. 
 
The mineralized bodies are arranged as mantos a nd are hosted mainly in the brown garnet skarn 
and in less proportion in silica hornfels. Locally in the south part of the project veins and veinlets of 
metric thicknesses are observed that were inte rpreted in parallel to the Española vein-fault. 
 
6.4.3 Mineralization at the Santos Mine 
 Chalcopyrite is the only primary copper sulphide pr esent in the Santos mine. In addition to copper 
mineralization, there are economic values of gold. Most frequent gangue minerals are pyrite, 
magnetite, actinolite, potassic feldsp ar, chlorite, biotite and hematite. 
 
In the Santos mine, three styles of mineralized  bodies are observed: veins, mantos, and breccia 
bodies. An important vein in the Santos mine is the Isabel Vein, which is oriented northwest-striking, 
and extends over 1 kilometre in length and between 4 and 30 metres in width. Manto-type 
mineralization occurs as tabular bodies located at  two sedimentary horizons located in the floor and 
roof of the albitophyre. The manto mineralization is characterized by variable iron contents with 
magnetite common in the north and deeper areas, and specular hematite in the south. Mineralization 
occurs within breccia bodies is typically contai ned with the albitophyre and lower andesite and is

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 6.4.4 Mineralization at the Alcaparrosa Mine 
 
Mineralization at the Alcaparrosa mine principally occurs as mantos that trend to the northeast and 
dip to the west. Ore mineralogy consists of chalco pyrite, pyrite, and magnetite, with trace pyrrhotite, 
molybdenite, and arsenopyrite. Mineralization at t he Alcaparrosa mine also occurs as veinlets 
defining dense stockwork, breccias (hydrothermal potassium feldspar and magnetite) as well as fine 
dissemination in biotite meta-andesites. High-grade bodies are also found in massive veins striking 
north-northwest, north, and east.

7 Deposit Types 
The copper-gold sulphide minera lization present at the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is 
generally referred to as iron oxide copper gol d (IOCG). Depending on lithology and the structural 
setting, the polymetallic sulphide mineralization can occur as veins, hydrothermal breccias, 
replacement mantos, and calc ic skarns (Sillitoe, 2003). 
 
The Candelaria IOCG deposit lies within the me tamorphic aureole of the Lower Cretaceous 
magmatic arc plutonic complex that is located within the Candelaria-Punta del Cobre district, 
Atacama Region, northern Chile. IOCG deposits are primarily defined by their elevated magnetite 
and / or hematite with elevated co pper and gold contents (Sillitoe, 2 003). The IOCG belt located in 
the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile and southern Peru is part  of a volcano-plutonic arc of 
Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. The arc is char acterized by voluminous tholeiitic to calc-alkaline 
plutonic complexes of gabbro to granodiorite co mposition and primitive, mantle-derived parentage. 
Major arc-parallel fault systems developed in response to extension and transtension induced by 
subduction roll-back at the retreating convergent margin. 
 
Most of the sulphide mineralizatio n at Candelaria and Ojos del Salado occurs in breccias, stockwork 
veinlets, and disseminations in andesite, especial ly where the rocks are st rongly foliated. Higher-
grade copper mineralization is controlled by st ratigraphy in mantos and by faults, trending 
predominantly northwest. The host rocks are ther mally metamorphosed (hornfels and skarn) in the 
aureole of the Copiapó Batholith, within 1 kilometr e from the intrusion. The top of the mineralization 
system consists of magnetite-amphibole skarn within calcareous meta-tuff mineralized with 
pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite (Figure 12).

8 Exploration 
8.1 General Overview 
 
Candelaria and Ojos del Salado (Santos and Alcaparrosa) are active mine operations that comprise the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex. Exploration work completed prior to commencement of 
mining is not relevant to this Technical Report. 
 
Ongoing exploration is conducted by Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado with the primary 
purpose of supporting mine operations and increasi ng Mineral Resource estimates. The exploration 
strategy is focused on tracing known mantos and ve in targets as extensions from current orebodies 
utilizing host rock and alteration features down dip and along strike from existing open pit and underground infrastructure. Historically, this stra tegy has proven very effective in defining new 
Mineral Resources available for underground mini ng. Exploration work is completed by mine 
personnel. 
 
Much of the exploration is conducted from underground, requiring significant underground 
development to provide adequate drilling stations. Re gional exploration is also undertaken on the 
large properties surrounding the mines to identify new targets and define new Mineral Resource 
areas for more detailed Mineral Resource exploration. 
 From 2010 to the end of June 2022, Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado have together 
invested more than US$267M in exploration to ex pand the Mineral Resources primarily below the 
Candelaria Open Pit, to the north and south of the pit, and at the three underground mines 
(Candelaria Underground, Santos and Alcaparrosa) . During this period, 3,780 core boreholes 
(1,051,068 metres) were drilled requiring over 15,0 00 metres of underground development to provide 
access for drilling. Since LMC purchased the CCMC in late 2014 to the end of June 2022, there has 
been an investment in exploration of approximately US$177M. During this period 2,336 core boreholes (678,070 metres) were drilled requiring over 4,000 metres of underground development. 
 
At Minera Candelaria, the Measured and Indicated Mi neral Resources increased significantly during 
the June 2022 reporting period. Increases are attr ibuted to the discovery of new mineralization, 
model integration, and changes in reporting cut-off grades. While mineralization at La Espanola had 
been previously identified by drilling between 1990 a nd 2004, it became a target of renewed interest 
after the results of a large-scale geophysical st udy identified a pronounced anomaly in the area. In 
2018, 77 additional drillholes for a total of 22,694 metres were drilled at La Espanola. In 2019, an 
additional 34 holes (8,027 metres) were drilled. Other increases are attributed to the extensive 
drilling program that occurred from 2018 to 2022. Mi neral Resource growth occurred in Candelaria 
UG South (Figure 13), Candelaria UG North (Fi gure 14), as well as the Santos and Alcaparrosa 
mines.

Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 29 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Overall, since 2014, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources at Minera Candelaria have 
increased by 92% due to the co mbination of drilling program su ccess, model in tegration and 
adjustment as well as changes in reporting cut-off grade.

At Minera Ojos del Salado, new Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates were prepared in 
the first half of 2018, extending the life of t he Santos mine to 2028. The Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resources in creased by more th an 70% over the year 2018 in Santos due to drilling, the 
consolidation of two independent block models into one (Santos: Figure 15) and lowering the 
underground cut-off grade from 0.60 to 0.55 and again to 0.45% copper. 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 31 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 At the Alcaparrosa mine, Mineral Resources increa sed by 46% due to drilli ng, the integration of 
seven block models into one (Alcaparrosa: Figu re 16) and lowering the underground cut-off grade 
from 0.60 to 0.55 and again to 0.45% copper. Mineralization remains open to the southwest and 
further potential exists in the east central and west  central zones outside of the current model. Wide 
spaced extension and infill drilling is  ongoing and will improve the confi dence in the continuity of the 
sulphide mineralization in both the Alcaparrosa and Santos mines.

In the Santos mine to the north of the Melendez  sector, sulphide mineraliz ation was confirmed to 
continue to the north. To the south, in the Malachit a sector, sulphide minera lization was confirmed in 
deeper horizons. In addition, during 2022, a N S&SAMT (Natural Source and Controlled Source 
Audio Magneto-Telluric) geophysical survey was perf ormed to the southern extents of Santos, the 
survey was performed to map structures which c ould be controlling the location/formation of vein 
type mineralization known to be adjacent to the area. Drilling has since co mmenced over the area 
with positive results within the low resistivity zones. 
 
Brownfield exploration drilling beg an late in 2017 with surface dr illing commencing in the south 
district of the Candelaria land concession in an area called Española. The Española project is an 
area approximately 2.5 kilometres south of the Candelaria Open Pit. Geophysical surveys performed 
in 2016 showed a gravimetric, appar ent chargeability and conductivity  anomaly coincident with a 
historic magnetic anomaly (Figure 17Figure 17). Fu rther investigation of the area found three shallow

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 historical boreholes intersected low grade minera lization, 0.20% to 0.49% copper from 24 to 165 
metres in length. A drilling campaign was developed in September 2017 to test the extent of the 
mineralization. When more miner alization was encountered, further drilling continued with the 
objective to delimit the mineralized body. In total, 79 drill platforms and roads were developed during 
the 2017 and 2018 drilling campaign, and 92 explorat ion and infill core boreholes totaling 31,370 
metres were drilled. A new Mineral Resource model  was constructed with this data to support 
Mineral Resource estimation. The Mineral Reso urce model was updated again in 2019, following 
additional drilling of 8,027 metres in 34 boreholes that was carried out in 2019. 
 
 
Figure 17: State of Data Before Discovery of Española 
 
 
Building on this success, an exploration program is planned for the period 2023 to 2027, maintaining 
operational fronts in the mines, tar geting the lateral extensions of the areas investigated since 2010 
and exploring district targets to the north and s outh of mining infrastructure within the Minera 
Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado land holdings. 
 
The planned exploration program (Table 5) incl udes approximately 1,160 metres of underground 
development, 171,500 metres of core drilling, and continued geophysical campaigns at a total 
estimated combined cost of US $48.0M. The 5-year exploration budget has decreased compared to 
previous years due to the significant increase in Mineral Resources within each of the mines, 
extending the life of the Candelaria Mining Comple x substantially for mine operations; therefore, 
decreasing pressure to sustain annual exploration drilling. Step out drilling will continue within the 
mines; however, drilling will focus on regional exploration within the district.

The objective of this exploration program is three-fold: to define and upgrade the classification of additional higher-grade Mineral Resources in the underground mines to replace the processing of 
lower grade feed from the open pit or surface st ockpiles and improve the life of mine copper 
production; to understand the Mineral Resource pot ential remaining in the underground mines; and, 
to explore the Candelaria District to supplement the depletion of Mineral Resources in the mines. 
 
The aggressive exploration program initiated in 2010 has resulted in significant new discoveries, with 
a positive impact on the life of the three undergroun d mines. In 2015, a new exploration and Mineral 
Resource development tool, Mineral Inventory Range Analysis (MIRA) was initiated with the purpose 
to understand the potential mineral inventory remainin g in the mines as well as identify the potential 
mineral inventory within the Candelaria land holdings. Since 2015, mineral inventories have 
increased across the Candelaria district as a resu lt of the aggressive exploration programs (drilling 
and geophysical surveys), block model integrations, and new discoveries in Santos, Alcaparrosa and 
Candelaria mines, and the new district discover y of Española. Confidence has grown with the 
positive results received by utilizing the MIRA tool in the exploration programs. It is expected that the 
Mineral Resources will continue to grow within the current mines and district. 
 
At Candelaria, 109,549 metres of underground core  were drilled, and 1,582 metres of underground 
development were completed since July 2018. This includes exploring the southern extensions of 
Mariana, Damiana, and Santa Gemita (24,541 metres  of core drilling), definition of the northern 
extensions of mineralization in Candelaria Underground (North Sector and Wedge Gap, 58,956 
metres), and to explore open pit potential from bot h the surface and underground (85,008 metres). CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 35 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 At the Santos mine, the 2018 exploration program included 122 metres of underground 
development, and a total of 16,534 metres of under ground core drilling divided between the Helena, 
Melendez North, Malaquita Deep sectors, and on t he surface in Isabel Oeste, and Santos Sur 
(Figure 15). 
 
At the Alcaparrosa mine, the 2018 exploration program included 348 metres of underground 
development, and a total of 16,521 metres of core drilli ng in the in the West Central area (Figure 16). 
 
In the district, additional core drilling was conducte d at Pirata Rincon (789 metres), Cora Kaiser 
(1,052 metres), and Ojancos Sur (1,564 metres; Figure 18).

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 In addition to the underground exploration programmes, various geophysical surveys were 
conducted to guide drilling programs within the Candelaria District. A 3D DCIP Survey was 
conducted in the south district over the Español a area. A CSAMT survey was performed over the 
south surface of Santos, with the objective of defining structures which could be controlling the 
location / formation of vein type mineralization known to be adjacent to Santos. An airborne 
magnetic/radiometric survey was flown over the entire district. Since completion of the larger, district-
scale airborne geophysical surveys in 2018, only limited, more local geophysical surveys have been 
carried out. Physical property measurements have been combined with geophysical data using the 
Common Earth Model (CEM). 
 
Magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measur ements and down-hole physical property logging 
have continued since 2018 to present and were used to assist interpreting geophysical data and 
map magnetic susceptibility of lithological units and improve g eological modelling. 
 
8.2 Exploration Performance 2018 to 2022 
 
Since acquiring the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex in late 2014, LMC has invested 
approximately US$177M in exploration (to the end of June 2022). These investments have 
significantly increased the Mineral Resources at all mines and extended the life of the operations by 
10 years to 2046. 
 
The current forward-looking exploration strategy is to: 
 
 Continue the development of the undergr ound headings within the existing mine 
infrastructure ahead of operations. 
 Test the extensions of mantos and ve ins, as well as exploring for deep seated 
mineralization. 
 Test high potential MIRA targets both within the mining infrastructure as well as in the 
district; explore outside the boundaries of sulfi de mineralization and review oxide potential. 
 Apply additional tools including new geophy sical applications; statistical analysis to 
geochemical sample results. 
 Continued use of the 3D targeting modelling t ool that integrates, geophysical survey data, 
geochemistry, structural components, field m apping, and drill hole information to assist in 
optimal drill hole targeting throughout the district. 
 
8.3 SRK Comments 
 
The considerable investment in exploration at Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado since 
2014 (approximately US$177M) has continued to demons trate the excellent potential for extending 
the sulphide zones in the three underground mine s and the generation of new discoveries amenable 
for underground mining in other areas of the properties. 
 
Step-out and infill drilling programs have resulted in the discovery of new mi neralization extensions 
throughout the property particularly at C andelaria Underground (North and South Sectors), 
Alcaparrosa and Santos. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 37 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 The period 2014 to 2022 has witnessed exploration success combined with operational efficiencies 
(cut-off grade reductions), and Mineral Resource estimation innovations (Mineral Resource model 
consolidations) which have significantly increas ed reported Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
amenable to underground extraction. Recent exploration in the district also highlights the potential of 
increasing Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves amenable to open pit extraction, as witnessed 
by the Española project. 
 A new 5-year exploration program (2023 to 2027) has been developed, which will target lateral 
extensions of the areas investigated since 2010 and exploring district targets to the north and south 
of mining infrastructure within Minera Candelaria l and holdings. This aggressive exploration program 
should continue to define and upgrade underground and open pit Mineral Resource estimates on the 
property. 
 
The exploration potential of the Candelaria Copper Mi ning Complex is excellent. The authors of This 
Report are of the opinion that the MIRA explorat ion and Mineral Resource development strategy will 
continue to complement the exploration program in the future, which should result in a continuous 
growth in Mineral Resources within the current mines and elsewhere in the district. 
 
The authors strongly support the development of t he 3D targeting modelling tool that integrates, 
geophysical survey data, geochemistry, struct ural components, field mapping, and borehole 
information to assist in optimal drill hole targeting throughout the district.

9.1 Drilling at Candelaria 
 
From 1990 to June 30, 2022, 4,689 core and perc ussion boreholes (1,361,873 metres) were drilled 
in and around the Candelaria mine.  Approximately 96% of all drilling comprised core boreholes. 
Approximately 80% of all core bo reholes were drilled using NQ eq uipment, the residual using HQ 
equipment. Initially, drilling was completed by Geotech Boyles Bros. S.A. Later, drilling services were 
provided by Connors Drilling, LLC and finally from 2012, Boart Longy ear was contracted to complete 
all drilling. In 2020, drilling was completed by Coruro Drilling and Arctic Drilling. In 2021, drilling was 
completed by Georock and Boggioni Drilling. Th roughout 2022, drilling has been carried out by 
Coruro Drilling and Boggioni Drilling.

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Until 2011, boreholes were surveyed by mine pers onnel. No information exists on instruments or 
methodologies used for these surveys. Since 2011,  SG Drill Servicios Geol (SG Drill) based in 
Copiapó, has been contracted to comp lete down-hole surveys. SG Dr ill uses a Reflex tool with 
readings at 3-metre intervals. Most of the boreh oles were drilled with an azimuth of 065 or 245 
degrees with inclinations betwee n -90 and +90 degrees. Table 6 summarizes th e drilling information

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 9.3 Drilling at Ojos del Salado 
 
9.3.1 Santos Mine 
 
In the Santos mine, a total 1,604 core boreholes  (323,591 metres) were drilled from underground 
and surface stations from 1988 until June 30, 2022. Since July 2017 drilling has occurred 
underground in sectors Meléndez Norte, Helena, and Malaquita, and from the surface drilling 
occurred over Isabel Oeste and Sout h Santos. Most of the boreholes were drilled with an azimuth of 
65 or 245 degrees with inclinations between -82 and +90 degrees. Borehole lengths vary between 
40 and 728 metres. Down-hole deviations are monito red at regular intervals using Reflex tools. 
Starting in 2019, downhole survey equipment was changed from Reflex to Axis Busca. Table 8 
shows a summary of the drilling activiti es completed for the Santos mine.

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 All boreholes are collared with HQ-sized equipment; boreholes size was reduced in long boreholes 
or in fracture zones. All drilling in the Santos mine was originally comple ted by the Connors Drilling 
Group. More recent drilling wa s completed by Boart-Longyear. 
 
9.3.2 Alcaparrosa Mine 
 The borehole data base for the Alcaparrosa mine contains 1,165 boreholes (283,133 metres) drilled 
from surface and underground locations from 1990 to June 30, 2022. Since July 2017 drilling has occurred in the west central sector of Alcapar rosa. Most of the boreholes were drilled with an 
azimuth of 65 and 245 degrees with inclinations  between -82 degrees a nd +90 degrees. Borehole 
lengths vary between 70 and 600 metres. Down-hole deviations are monitored at regular intervals 
using Reflex tools.

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Commencing in 2019, downhole survey equipment was changed from Reflex to Axis Busca. Table 9 
shows a summary of the drilling activities  completed for the Alcaparrosa mine. 
 
9.4 Sampling Method and Approach 
 
Logging and sampling procedures at Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado operations 
follow similar approaches using documented protocols. Geology logging records information about 
rock type, mineralogy, textures, structures, mi neralization, and alteration. Geotechnical logging 
records information about core recovery, rock quality designation (RQD), hardness, and the number 
and nature of fractures. Samples are regularly collected for geomechanical testing by lithological 
type at selected intervals for uniaxial, triaxial and disc tension compression analysis. In addition, 
point load tests were performed at selected inte rvals. Until January 2012, geotechnical logging was 
performed by mine personnel, after this date that work was contracted. Core photographs were 
initially taken of uncut core of selected drill holes. During 2017, core photography was implemented 
for all drill holes, and the subsequent information is loaded and stored into the AcQuire database. 
 
In the Candelaria pit, before 2007, samples were taken at 1-metre intervals. After 2007 onward, 
sample intervals for the open pit were increased to 2 metres. Analytical samples were taken from core cut lengthwise using a diamond saw. Half of the core is retained in core boxes for reference. 
For the Candelaria Open Pit, core was sampled fr om two bench heights above known mineralization 
to the bottom of the borehole. For the underground mines, core is sampled based on visible 
sulphides. The top parts of boreholes were not sampled. Sampling is carried out by a contractor 
under the supervision of mine personnel. At Candelaria, in late 2016, in the underground mines, core 
sample length was increased from 1 to 2 metres in  length. Sampling procedures are carried out by a 
contractor under the supervision of personnel  from Mina Candelaria's Exploration group. 
 
Before 2014, primary information such as collar coordinates, survey data, as well as geological and geotechnical logging data was entered into Microsoft®  Excel sheets and later aggregated into a final 
database by authorized personnel from the geol ogy team. Since 2015 logging information is 
captured digitally and transferred to the ma in project AcQuire database automatically. 
 
9.5 SRK Comments 
 
The authors of this Technical Report have witnes sed drilling and sampling activities on the 
operations on numerous occasions and believes t hat the drilling and sampling procedures adopted 
by the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex are cons istent with generally recognized industry best 
practices. The resultant drilling pattern is sufficiently dense to interpret the geometry and the 
boundaries of the copper and gold mineralization with  confidence. Core samples were collected by 
competent personnel using procedures meeting gene rally accepted industry best practices. The 
process is undertaken or supervised by suitably qualified geologists. 
 
The authors conclude that the samples are represen tative of the source materials and there is no 
evidence that the sampling process introduced a bias.

10 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 
10.1 Historical Samples 
 
The borehole sampling preparation, analyses, an d security procedures utilized by ENAMI and its 
predecessors between 1929 and 1985 are unknown. 
 
10.2 Core Samples (1985 to Present) 
 
10.2.1 Overview 
 Analytical samples informing the Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Resources were prepared and 
assayed at the Candelaria mine site. In 2014, the la boratory was certified to International Standards 
Organization (ISO)17025 by the National Institute of  Standardization (INN) of Chile for the analyses 
of copper, iron, zinc, and silver. Compliance to t he ISO standard is being verified yearly by the INN. 
The laboratory is not independent from Minera Candelaria. It is managed by the Candelaria 
Processing Department.  
Analytical samples informing the Ojos del Salado Mineral Resources were prepared and assayed by 
Intertek (formerly Vigalab) in Paipote, Chile. Inte rtek is a global group oper ating 13 laboratories in 
Chile with a management system accredited to IS O9001. Intertek's laboratories are independent 
from Minera Ojos del Salado. 
 
Minera Candelaria uses Intertek and Geolaqium in the Paipote Sector of Copiapo, Chile as an 
umpire laboratory. These laboratories are independent of Minera Candelaria. 
 The sample analyses used for the Mineral Resource reporting for the Española project were 
prepared by Geolaquim Ltda. (Geolaquim) (80%) and Intertek l (20%). Geolaquim is certified under 
regulation ISO 17025 by the INN for concentrated minerals and others (soluble copper, total copper, 
iron and gold). 
 
Prior to 2006, Minera Ojos del Salado used Geolab as an umpire laboratory. As far as SRK was able 
to determine, Geolab is independent from Miner a Ojos del Salado. After 2006, Minera Ojos del 
Salado used ALS Limited (ALS) laboratory in Coquimbo as an umpire laboratory. The management 
system of the ALS Minerals Group laboratories is  accredited to ISO-9001:2000 by QMI Management 
Systems. ALS is independent from Minera Ojos del Salado. Since 2016, the Candelaria laboratory 
has been used as an umpire laboratory. 
 
The sample preparation and analytical methodologies used for assaying Candelaria, Española, and 
Ojos del Salado samples are similar.

Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 45 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Upon reception, sample details are recorded and insertion points for quality control samples in the 
sample stream are determined. Sample preparati on includes drying at 105 degrees Celsius in a 
forced air furnace, primary crushing to 100% pa ssing 5 millimetres, and secondary crushing cycle to 
90% passing 1.68 millimetres (12 mesh). Grinding  tests are conducted on every 40th sample. 
 
From the crushed material two 1-kilogram samples (Sample A and B) are prepared using a rotary 
splitter. Coarse rejects are retained and kept in storage. Both samples A and B are pulverized 
separately to 95% passing 0.106 millimetres (140 mesh). Sample A is subdivided into four 
subsamples: one subsample with approximately 200 grams, and three subsamples weighing 
approximately 100 grams each (A1, A2, and A3) and are used for quality control. Sample B is 
subdivided into two subsamples: one weighing approximately 200 grams and the other (B1) 
approximately 100 grams. The two heavier subsamples  are kept for future reference or as backup 
should more sample material be required. 
 Copper, silver, zinc, and iron are analyzed by multi acid digestion and atomic absorption 
spectroscopy (AAS). Copper  assays greater than 6% are re-anal yzed systematically. Gold is also 
assayed in 30-gram aliquots by fire assay with  AAS finish. Minera Ojos del Salado began assaying 
for zinc in January 2015. 
 
Assay data are loaded directly from digital assay re sult files into the final database in order to 
minimize entry errors. 
 
10.3 Specific Gravity Data 
 
Specific gravity (SG) is measured systematically over the full sample intervals. For each sample 
interval, all core fragments larger than 5 centim etres in length are collected and used to measure 
specific gravity using a water displacement me thod without paraffin coating. Measurements are 
duplicated every 20 measurements and the scale is checked frequently using a 2-kilogram weight. 
 
10.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 
 
Quality assurance and quality control programs are ty pically set in place to ensure the reliability and 
trustworthiness of the exploration data. They include written field procedures and independent 
verifications of aspects such as drilling, surv eying, sampling and assaying, data management, and 
database integrity. Appropriate documentation of quality control measures and regular analysis of 
quality control data are important as a safeguard for the project data and form the basis for the 
quality assurance program implemented during exploration. 
 Analytical control measures typically involve in ternal and external laboratory control measures 
implemented to monitor the precision and accuracy of the sampling, preparation, and assaying. They 
are also important to prevent sample mix-up and mo nitor the voluntary or inadvertent contamination 
of samples. Assaying protocols typically involve regular duplicate and replicate assays and insertion 
of quality control samples. Check assaying is typically performed as an additional reliability test of 
assaying results. This typically involves re-assay ing a set number of rejects and pulps at a second 
umpire laboratory CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 46 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 10.4.1 Historical Anal ytical Quality Control at Alcaparrosa 
 
No information exists about the analytical qualit y control procedures at Alcaparrosa between 1929 
and 1985. 
 
10.4.2 Analytical Quality Control (1985 to Present) 
 
Minera Candelaria and Española 
The analytical quality control program implemented at Candelaria includes the use of control 
samples (coarse and pulp duplicate samples and reference material samples) inserted within all samples submitted for assaying. Pulp duplicate samples are inserted at a rate of one every 
20 samples. Preparation duplicate samples from t he B samples (see Section 10.2) are inserted at a 
rate of one every 40 samples. Pulp sample duplicates A (A1, A2, A3) are inserted in a range of one 
every 20 samples (A2) in the same laboratory. A dupl icate every 20 metres (A3) is sent to an umpire 
laboratory. Duplicates for sample preparation B (B1) are inserted in a range of one every 
40 samples. 
 
Prior to 2015, six different reference materials were created from Candelaria samples and certified 
for copper and gold by round robin testing under the supervision of ALS Minerals in Copiapó. Copper grades of the reference material range from 0.50 to 3.69% copper. Reference material samples were 
inserted at a rate of one every 20 samples. 
 
Since 2015, reference materials have been prepared by INTEM laboratory. New reference materials 
were created for copper and gold of low grade, medium grade, high grade and blanks. Ten 
laboratories are used in the round robin process to define the recommended grade and variance of 
the reference materials.  
After sample preparation, pulps are relabeled. A duplicate and approximately 5% of the samples are 
sent to the umpire laboratory. 
 
Analytical quality control procedures were impr oved during 2016. Four reference materials were 
prepared (In-PT-5301 procedure) at the INTEM laboratory in Antofagasta, Chile following the ISO-34 
guide (General Requirements for the Competence of Reference Material Producers). The four 
reference material samples are: 
 
 IN-BMF-233: Blank 2016, (0.004% copper, 1.0 parts per million (ppm) silver, 0.01 ppm 
gold) 
 IN-C080-230: Low grade 2016 (0.293% copper, 2.2 ppm silver, 0.079 ppm gold) 
 IN-C080-231: Medium grade 2016 (0.658% copper, 2.8 ppm silver, 0.138 ppm gold) 
 IN-C080-232: High grade 2016, (1.373% copper, 3.1 ppm silver, 0.275 ppm gold) 
 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 47 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 During 2018 new reference material samples were prepared by INTEM laboratory according to 
procedure IN-PT-5301: 
 
 IN-BMF-333: Blank 2018, (0.004% copper, < 1.0 ppm silver, < 10 ppb gold) 
 IN-C080-316: Low Grade 2018, (0.208% copper, 0.9 ppm silver, 0.041 ppm gold) 
 IN-C080-317: Average Grade 2018, (0.572% copper, 2.5 ppm silver, 0.155 ppm gold) 
 IN-C080-318: High Grade 2018, (1.465% copper, 8.0 ppm silver, 0.346 ppm gold) 
 
Since 2016, exploration data are managed through an AcQuire database, which include quality control management features for sample coordi nates from borehole surveys and data management 
tools. Sample numbering and labelling is controll ed through AcQuire, including insertion of quality 
control samples and consignment notes to the prim ary laboratories. Analytical results are received 
electronically and managed through AcQuire with quality control filters. Samples outside defined 
limits are rejected by AcQuire and flagged for furthe r investigation. The AcQuire system includes 
features for reporting analytical results and pr eparing bias charts and time series plots. 
 
Minera Ojos del Salado 
Prior to 2006, the analytical quality control program at  Ojos del Salado consisted of the use of control 
samples (pulp duplicate samples) and the use of ch eck assaying at an umpire laboratory. No field 
duplicates, standard reference material, or blank material were submitted prior to 2006. 
 
Analysis of quality control data during this time  by AMEC (2013b) highlighted the poor performance 
of the pulp duplicate samples, especially for copper. Because the duplicate samples performed 
better for gold, AMEC (2013b) concluded that the overall performance of t he quality control data was 
satisfactory. 
 Starting in 2006, Minera Ojos del Salado changed the analytical quality control procedures to 
replicate those in use at Candelaria. 
 
Since 2016, Minera Ojos del Salado samples are now also managed through the AcQuire system 
similarly to Minera Candelaria. 
 
10.5 Sample Security 
 
Information about the sample security in the histor ical exploration period prior to Minera Candelaria 
and Minera Ojos del Salado's involvement is unavailable. 
 All drilling assay samples are collected by a cont ractor under the direct supervision of a mine 
geologist. Samples from Candelaria are processed and analyzed entirely at the mine site. Samples 
from Ojos del Salado are shipped directly from the property to the Intertek laboratory in Paipote. 
 
Assay samples are collected by appropriately qualif ied staff at the laboratories. Sample security 
involved maintaining the chain of custody of samp les to prevent inadvertent  contamination or mixing 
of samples and rendering active tampering as difficult as possible. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 48 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 During the site visit, the qualified persons found no  evidence of active tampering or inadvertent 
contamination of assay samples collected either on the Candelaria or Ojos del Salado properties. 
 
10.6 SRK Comments 
 The qualified persons reviewed the field procedures  and analytical quality control measures used at 
the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex operations. In the opinion of the authors of this Technical 
Report, company personnel used care in the collection and management of the field and assaying 
exploration and production data. Based on historic al reports and data available, the authors have no 
reason to doubt the reliability of exploration and production information provided by the CCMC. 
 
The introduction of the AcQuire database / analytic al data management system in 2016 has further 
enhanced the integrity exploration data and anal ytical quality control procedures at Minera 
Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado. The reports and analytical results examined by authors 
suggest that the analytical results delivered by the primary laboratories used by the CCMC are free 
of apparent bias. 
 
In the opinion of the qualified persons, the sampli ng preparation, security, and analytical procedures 
used by the CCMC are consistent with generally a ccepted industry best practices and are therefore 
adequate to support Mineral Resource estimation.

11 Data Verification 
11.1 Verifications by the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex 
 
Exploration and production work completed by the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex was conducted using documented procedures and involved extensive verification and validation of 
exploration and production data prior to them being considered for geological modelling and Mineral 
Resource estimation. During drilling, experience d mine geologists implemented industry standard 
measures designed to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the exploration data. 
 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex technical staff monitor analytical quality control data on a real-
time basis. Exploration data are managed through an AcQuire database, which includes extensive 
quality control features and tools to facilitate ongoing monitoring and reporting. Quality control 
failures are investigated, and appropriate actions are taken when necessary, including requesting re-
assaying of certain batches of samples. 
 
11.2 Verifications by SRK 
 
11.2.1 Site Visits 
 Technical consultants from SRK have visited the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado properties on 
numerous occasions (Table 1). In accordance with  National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, a team of 
professionals under the supervision of SRK visited the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado properties 
from June 10 to 12, 2014 and from June 14 to 16, 2014, accompanied by representatives of LMC. 
The team included Glen Cole, PGeo; Gary Poxleitner, PEng; and Maria Ines Vidal, MAusIMM from 
SRK, and Daniel Sepulveda, and John Nilsso n, PEng, both independent consultants. 
 
SRK conducted another site visit from July 6 to July 10, 2015. The team included Jean-Francois 
Couture, PGeo; Gary Poxleitner, PEng; and Ma ria Ines Vidal, MAusIMM, from SRK, and John 
Nilsson, PEng, an independent consultant. Jean -Francois Couture, Gary Poxleitner, and John 
Nilsson are qualified persons pursuant  to National Instrument 43-101. 
 
SRK returned to the Candelaria Copper Mining Co mplex from December 14 to 16, 2016. The team 
included Glen Cole, PGeo, Benny Zhang, PEng, Maria Ines Vidal, MAusIMM, from SRK and John 
Nilsson, PEng, an independent consultant. 
 
On November 8 and 9, 2017 Glen Cole, PGeo, Benn y Zhang, PEng, Maria Ines Vidal, MAusIMM, 
from SRK visited the Candelaria Copper Mini ng Complex. John Nilsson, PEng, an independent 
consultant, also visited the mine complex from October 9 to 13, 2017. 
 
On October 30 and 31, 2018 a team of SRK consultants comprising Glen Cole, PGeo; Sean 
Kautzman, PEng; Maria Ines Vidal, MAusIMM, from SRK visited the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex. John Nilsson, PEng, an independent consult ant, also visited the mine complex at this time. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 50 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 The most recent site was undertaken by a team of four SRK consultants comprising Messrs. Cole, 
Banerjee, Castro and Zhang and Ms. Ines Vidal visited the site during October 4 and 5, 2022. 
 
The site visits took place during active drilling and pr oduction activities. Aspects that could materially 
impact the integrity of the data informing the Mi neral Resources (core logging, sampling, analytical 
results, and database management) were reviewed with Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del 
Salado staff. SRK also interviewe d mine staff to ascertain expl oration and production procedures 
and protocols. 
 
The qualified persons examined core from several boreholes and found that the logging information 
accurately reflects actual core. The lithology c ontacts checked by the qualified persons match the 
information reported in the core logs. 
 
On October 5, 2022, SRK consultants toured the Candelaria Norte underground mine, one of the three underground operations. The underground mine tour included inspections of underground 
infrastructure, mine development and sub-level stoping activities. An inspection of the Española 
open pit project and the Los Diques tailings facility was also undertaken. SRK also met with technical 
discipline heads to discuss aspects of the latest Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. 
 
11.2.2 Review of Expl oration Data and Mineral Resource Models 
 
The qualified persons reviewed the borehole databases, Mineral Resource models, documented 
Mineral Resource estimation procedures and digi tal mine infrastructure wireframes. For the 
preparation of this Technical Report, the qualified persons were able to reproduce block model estimates for a representative sample of the block models to a satisfactory degree. 
 
The qualified persons also completed statistical comparison of the global block models grade against 
the informing drilling data and visually compared on plans and sections the block models against the 
informing composites to confirm that the various models are generally an adequate representation of 
the distribution of the copper, gold, and silver mineralization. 
 
The Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Resource model is routinely compared against the production 
model derived from blasthole samples and the Mineral Resource estimation parameters are periodically adjusted accordingly. On average, the Mineral Resource model under evaluates the 
metal content of a bench by a few percent relative to the blasthole model.  
 
After comparing the open pit and underground Mineral Resource models against the informing 
composites and the statistics of the production model (long and short-term models), the authors 
conclude that the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex estimation approach produces a reasonable 
and reliable model adequate to support open pit mining and which adequately reconciles to monthly production data.

12 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is a mature  operation. Metallurgical test work results 
completed prior to commissioning of the Candelaria  and PAC processing plants are not relevant to 
this Technical Report. Both processing plants have been in operation for many years and produce 
copper concentrates sold to customers worldwi de (see Section 18). A summary of both processing 
plant performance is provided in Section 16 of Th is Report. Metal recovery estimates have been 
derived for each ore type based on historical pl ant performance. Other than those stated in 
Sections 16 and 18, there are no other processing fa ctors or deleterious elements that might have a 
significant impact on economic extraction. 
 
As part of the ongoing operations, both processing  plants undertake ongoing testing programs. 
 
12.1 Ore Types 
 
The Candelaria deposit is classified as an iron ox ide copper gold (IOCG). The polymetallic sulfide 
mineralization occurs as veins, hydrothermal bre ccias, replacement mantos and calcic skarns. The 
sulfide deposits are hosted in volcanic ro cks of the Punta del Cobre formation. 
 
Figure 20 illustrates the position of the geological uni ts (Undidad Geologica or UG) relative to the pit. 
Some of the softer material UG 67 being at t he bottom of the pit and currently being mined. Major 
mineral phases present in Candelaria's ores are biotite, K-feldspar, quartz, and plagioclase. UGs 57 
and 67 contain up to 40% magnetite which is being recovered from the plant tailings.

There are four geological units defined by CCMC  that affect grinding performance. They are 
classified as Ultra Soft, Soft, Intermediate, Hard a nd Ultra Hard ranging in grinding specific energy 
from 6.5 kWh/t to 10 kWh/t (see Table 10).

The sulphide mineralization is dominated by py rite, while copper is present as chalcopyrite. 
Chalcopyrite is present across all size fractions with  the majority in the 38 to 150 µm range. Similarly, 
the dominant mineralogy species (including iron oxides ) maintain their presence across all particle 
sizes. Gold and silver are associated with sul phide minerals, primarily chalcopyrite and pyrite. 
Varying gold content in the pyrite is associ ated with gold losses to flotation tailings. 
 
12.2 Metallurgical Testing 
 
Minera Candelaria maintains regular metallurgical testing programs that are incorporated into 
statistical models to predict metallurgical performance of mill throughput, metal recovery and final 
concentrate grade. Metallurgical tests condu cted prior to 2018 have been summarized in the 
previous Technical Report. Metallurgical tests are generally conducted at sp ecialized facilities such 
as the Universidad de Atacama and at commercial th ird-party laboratories in Chile, including SGS 
Mineral Services.  
Internal test work includes SAG Power Index ( SPI), SAG Mill Comminution (SMC) and Bond Ball Mill 
(BWi) testing along with laboratory flotation test s for routine characterization and ongoing adjustment 
/ development of geometallurgical models. SPI testing is being superseded by SMC tests as a 
reference of SAG mill-related ore hardness. The SPI methodology was found to be less sensitive in 
characterising Hard and Extra Hard ore types (UGs 57, 59 and 77). Table 11 summarizes 
comminution tests completed from 2019 to 2022. For example, 143 samples from Phases 10 to 12 
were BWi, SMC and PLI tested while only 30 samples from these regions were SPI tested.

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 12.3 Plant Performance Estimates 
 
CCMC maintains throughput and copper recovery  forecasting models that are updated and 
maintained by Candelaria personnel. Figure 21 sh ows the structure of t he throughput forecasting 
model that uses UGs, laboratory-measured spec ific energy (kWh/t), Rock Quality Designation 
(RQD), weight fraction of -25 millimetres after blas ting and pebble production rate to predict grinding 
circuit power requirements and plant capacity (for an assumed mill availability). 
 
 
Figure 21: Throughput Forecasting Model (Schematic) 
Source: CCMC, 2022 
  
CCMC also maintains a copper recovery model last updated in 2018, that includes factors for UG, 
stockpile material, copper and zinc head grades. A schematic of the model is shown in Figure 22, 
where copper tails grade is estimated to calc ulate plant recovery from the estimated copper 
concentrate grade. Geological units with different  corresponding hardness influence throughput and 
coarseness of the grinding circuit product. Aging in stockpiles before processing potentially oxidizes 
sulfide minerals resulting in lower flotation recove ry. Higher zinc in the feed reduces final copper 
recovery by diluting the final concentrate grade.  The effects of secondary copper minerals like 
chalcocite and covellite are not included in the copper recovery model. 
 
Gold and silver recoveries are not related to UG and estimated using the values shown in Table 12, based on gold and silver feed grade. This model wa s generated by CCMC using recent operating 
results. It can be seen that both gold and silver reco very have a very narrow range with limited effect 
of head grade.

Figure 23 shows monthly copper recovery from 2018 to 2022 compared with model forecasts. The 
forecast model compares well with actual recoveri es from 2018 to mid-2020. After this point, the 
model overestimates recoveries by up to 2%. It is  to be noted that the forecast is prepared with an 
indication of the ore sourcing (including reclaime d low-grade stockpile material), ore types and 
respective feed grades, as per the mine plan. Any devi ation from this plan are likely to contribute to a 
differential between the forecast and the actual recoveries realized.

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 12.4  SRK Comments 
 
The copper recovery model used by CCMC has not been updated for a number of years and since 
2020, the model estimates are deviating from actual plant results. It is the authors' opinion that the 
CCMC recovery model be reviewed and updated to re flect recent plant performance and potentially 
the greater amount of stockpiled material being proc essed. (Currently, all stockpiled material is 
applied the same, discounted recoveries.) Factors such as zinc grade and stockpile ageing may 
have a greater effect on copper recovery compared to when the model was originally developed. 
 It is author's opinion that CCMC can improve t heir recovery and concentrate grade forecasting 
models, based on recent  plant operating data.

13 Mineral Resource Estimates 
13.1 Introduction 
 
Mineral Resource models discussed in this se ction are updates to 2018 models, documented in the 
SRK (2018) Technical Report. The Mineral Resources for Minera Candelaria comprise, primarily, the 
Candelaria iron oxide copper gold deposit. The central area of this deposit is mined by open pit 
methods and its northeast, south and west flanks are currently mined or planned to be mined by 
underground methods (Figure 4). The northeast flank of the Candelaria Pit, called Candelaria 
Underground North Sector, is currently mined by underground methods. In 2018 a new sector, the 
Wedge Gap, was included. It is located between t he Candelaria Underground North Sector and the 
ultimate limits of the Candelaria Open Pit and will be eventually mined by underground mining methods. In the 2022 update, the Wedge Gap wa s included in the Candelaria Underground North 
Mineral Resource model. The Damiana, Susana, Ma riana and West areas are located, clockwise in 
that order, from the south to t he west flanks of the Candelaria Open Pit are jointly known as the 
Candelaria Underground South Sector (Figure 7) , being mined by underground methods. In 2018, 
Mineral Resources were delineated for the first time at the Española project, which is a satellite 
deposit located 4 kilometres southwest of the C andelaria Open Pit. This area will be mined by open 
pit methods, starting in 2026. 
 
The Mineral Resources for Minera Ojos del Salado comprise two deposits, Alcaparrosa and Santos, 
currently being mined by underground mining methods. 
 
Since 2016, the Mineral Resource models are gen erated by the Resource Definition Department of 
the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex. The Mineral Resource models for the Candelaria 
Underground South and North sectors are separate d from the Mineral Resource model for the 
Candelaria Open Pit. These Mineral Resource models of Candelaria Open Pit, Candelaria 
Underground sectors and Española were updated in 2 022 with new drilling information available to 
December 31, 2021. 
 
The integrated Mineral Resource model for the Santos deposit was expanded in 2018 to include the 
areas of Veta Isabel (Malaquita SE) and Cuer po Nuevo. In 2018, the new integrated Mineral 
Resource model for the Alcaparrosa deposit co mprises the seven areas modelled and reported 
separately until 2017. These Minera Ojos del Sala do Mineral Resource models for Alcaparrosa and 
Santos were updated in 2022 with recent drilling in formation available to February 28, 2022, and 
March 31, 2022, respectively. 
 The authors of this Technical Report reviewed a nd audited the Mineral Resource models generated 
by the personnel of the Resource Definition Depar tment of the Candelaria Complex. This section 
outlines the Mineral Resource estimation met hodology and summarizes the key assumptions 
considered for the preparation of the open pit and underground Mineral Resource models during the 
third quarter of 2022. Table 13 tabulat es the block models updated in 2022. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 58 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 In the opinion of the qualified person, the Miner al Resource evaluation reported herein is a 
reasonable representation of the Mineral Resource s found at the CCMC at the current level of 
sampling as of December 31, 2021 for the Candelaria models and March 31, 2022 for the Minera 
Ojos del Salado models. The Mineral Resources were estimated in conformity with generally 
accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines 
(November 2019)  and are reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National 
Instrument 43-101. Mineral Resources are not  Mineral Reserves and have not demonstrated 
economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources will be 
converted into Mineral Reserves. 
 
13.2 Mineral Resource Estimati on and Classification Procedures 
 
In 2022, a similar estimation methodology was adopted for both the Candelaria Open Pit and the 
Candelaria Underground models (the North Sect or and the South Sector). The estimation 
methodology for the Candelaria Open Pit is discussed in addition to the methodologies for the 
Candelaria Underground and for the Española projec t and the Minera Ojos del Salado (Alcaparrosa 
and Santos) deposits. In the 2022 update, the methodol ogy is largely unchanged from the previous 
update in 2018. Table 13 below is a tabulation of the different block models with their respective data 
cut-off and completion dates.

13.2.1 Minera Candelaria Open Pit and Underground Sectors 
 The Candelaria Underground South Sector Mineral Resource model includes four areas: Damiana, 
Susana, Mariana, and West. The Mineral Resource  model for the Candelaria Underground North 
Sector comprises 19 areas (Candelaria Norte, Norte, Lila 1,  Lila 2, Lila 3, Lila 4, Lila 5, Lila 6, Lila 7, 
Lila 8, Lila 9, Lila 10, West North, West Central,  West South, Elisa, Elis a North, Elisa North 2, and 
the Wedge Gap). 
 
The global database available for the 2022 Mineral Resource estimation of the Candelaria Open Pit 
and the Underground (North and S outh sectors) include 2,112 (7 99,591 metres) surface and 2,297 
(530,724 metres) underground core boreholes. Perc ussion drilling and geotechnical holes were not 
considered for the Mineral Resource estimation. All exploration data are securely managed within 
the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex Acquire data base. Table 14 summarizes the data effectively 
used for building the different Mineral Resource models of Candelaria Open Pit and Underground Sectors. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 59 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 At the database cut-off date December 31, 2021, t he data informing the Mineral Resources of the 
Candelaria Open Pit and the Underground South Sector comprised 3,814 core and percussion 
boreholes (1,128,357 metres). This includes 213 core boreholes (64,315 metres) drilled since 2018. 
The number of samples effectively used is differ ent for both sectors because the different domains 
considered in the Open Pit and Underground South Se ctors. The data used for the Mineral Resource 
estimation of the Candelaria Underground North sect or is a subset of the total Candelaria district 
drilling database comprising 2,262 core boreholes (558,067 metres). This includes 398 core boreholes (118,456 metres), drilled since 2018. 
 
The Candelaria Open Pit block model consists of 10- by 10- by 16-metre cells encompassing all the 
Candelaria Open Pit area and includes the Candelaria Underground South Sector and a portion of 
the Candelaria Underground North Sector. The block models generated for the Candelaria 
Underground South, and the Candelaria Underground Nort h, sectors, consist of 5- by 5- by 4-metre 
cells.  
Coded drilling data were used to generate 35-me tre spaced transversal (southwest-northeast) 
sections for the geology and grade boundaries. 35 -metre spaced longitudinal  (southeast-northwest) 
sections and 16-metre spaced plans were built for the grade boundaries only. The lithological 
sections and plans were modelled within MineSight software as polyline files and were used together 
with the coded drilling data to build the lithological solids through implicit modelling in MineSight and 
Leapfrog software. The resulting solids were used to  code the blocks within the different lithological 
units. The modelled surface of the Lar fault was used  to divide the Open Pit block model in the East 
and West sectors. Two mineralization types viz. mantos, and veins were also modelled by interpretation on sections and plans. The grade boundaries in sections and plans were used to code 
all block models as three categories (less than 0.2%, above 0.2%, and above 1.5% copper) called 
'ore types. The combination of the lithologica l units, mineralization types and three ore types 
generate the 'geological units' or domains coded in the block models. 
 
The individual samples were composited to a 16-metre length, which corresponds to the open pit 
bench height, for the Open Pit Mineral Resource model, and to a 4-metre length for the Underground Mineral Resource models. The composite copper, gold, silver and zinc grades, and magnetite 
contents were obtained as averages weighted by t he specific gravity and the length of individual 
samples. The composites were also coded by the geological and ore type codes. 
 
The assessment and modelling of spatial continuity of copper, gold, silver and zinc composites, 
magnetite content, and specific gravity was perform ed using the Snowden Supervisor software within 
geological units and for the East and West sectors se parately. All these variables were normal score 
transformed to analyze their corresponding anisotropy directions through variogram maps and to 
generate experimental variograms along such directions. The anisotropy directions were verified against the observed grade continuity in blast hole data within the different geological units. The 
variogram models fitted on the experimental normal scores variograms were back transformed for 
their use in the estimation of the variables. 
 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 60 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 The nearest neighbour kriging algorithm (NNK) was used for the estimation of all variables in all 
Candelaria Mineral Resource models, except for specific gravity where ordinary kriging (OK) was 
used in the Candelaria Open Pit and the Candelar ia Underground South Sector Mineral Resource 
models. Estimation was performed in two passes. For all metals in all geological units, the first pass 
used a 100- by 100- by 50-metre search box ori ented according to the copper variogram model. The 
dimensions and orientation of the second pass search ellipsoid  for in each geological unit was 
guided by the second structure of  their corresponding copper vari ogram. For both passes, the 
minimum and maximum number of composites, and maximum number of composites per borehole 
were 2, 16 and 3, respectively. This configuration of informing data applied for all Candelaria models, 
metals, and domains, except for the waste rock mi neral type (outside the 0.2% copper grade shell) in 
the Candelaria Underground North sector, where a minimum of one composite was used. Differently 
from the metals, the estimation of specific gravit y was performed using a spherical search with a 
minimum of two composites and a maximum of 12, with a maximum of 3 composites per borehole for 
each lithological type.  
Under the NNK estimation process, an outlier search restriction to a distance equivalent to one and a 
half the lateral cell size (15 metres for the open pit models, 7.5 metres for the Candelaria South 
Sector and variable distances for different metals  and domains for the Candelaria North Sector) was 
applied to the copper, gold, silver and zinc, and ma gnetite content exceeding the 97.8 percentile of 
their corresponding populations within each litholog ical unit. No outlier restriction was applied for the 
estimation of the specific gravity in any sector. 
 
The Lar fault surface was used as a hard boundary for the estimation of all variables in the Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Resource model. In all models, Open Pit and Underground, the 
estimation of copper, gold and silver were constrained by the ore type and the lithological codes. The 
estimation of zinc, magnetite content and specific  gravity was constrained only by the lithological 
units. 
 
The 0.2% and the 1.5% copper grade shells defini ng the three main ore types were used as soft and 
hard boundaries, respectively. The boundaries between lithological units were considered as hard. In Candelaria North, a hard boundary was used between  manto and vein types of mineralization. Table 
14 summarizes the data and estimation strategy used to build the four different Candelaria Open Pit 
and Underground Mineral Resource models. 
 
The Mineral Resource models were validated against short-term models generated using blasthole 
data.

 The Mineral Resource classification criteria for all the four Candelaria Open pit and underground 
models are comparable to those used in 2018. They include the distance to the informing 
composites and the minimum number of boreholes used for their estimation. In the case of the 
Candelaria Open Pit, the distance criterion is the distance to the nearest informing composite, 
whereas for the Candelaria Underground North, and the Candelaria Underground South sectors 
models, it is the average distance of all informing composites. 
 Table 15 summarizes the classification criteria for all Candelaria models. Based on these criteria, the 
final limits between the different categories were smoothed manually to ensure the continuity of the 
Mineral Resources for the underground models.

13.2.2 Española Project 
 At the data cut-off date December 31, 2021, the dat a informing the Mineral Resource model update 
of the Española Project comprised 159 core bore holes (47,437 metres) which included 30,497 assay 
samples (Table 16). A grade shell at 0.2% total co pper was constructed using implicit modelling, as 
well as solids for 12 lithological units. 
 
The raw assay samples were composited to 8-metre length with the composite grades calculated as 
averages weighted by the length and specific de nsity of the raw samples. The variogram models 
were fitted on the experimental covariances of co pper, gold, silver, magnetite and zinc and specific 
gravity per lithological units.  
The block model for the Española project consists of  10- by 10- by 8-metre cells coded by lithological 
units, mineral types, and their position inside or outside the grade shell. The NNK algorithm was 
used for the estimation of all variables using two estimation passes informed by a minimum of three 
composites, a maximum of 14 and a restriction of at  most three composites per borehole. The first 
pass search consisted of a 150- by 150- by 50-met res box, whereas the dimensions and orientation 
of second pass search ellipsoid was guided by the ranges and orientation of the second variogram 
model structure for each variable and lithological unit. 
 In the estimation process, the influence of hi gh grades exceeding the 97.8 percentile of the 
population in each lithological unit was restricted to  a distance equivalent to one and a half the 
dimension of the individual blocks, this is 15 metres. The 0.2% copper grade shell encompassing the 
"Mantos" domain was used as a hard boundary. Th e lithologic units contacts were considered as 
soft.

The classification criteria for the Española proj ect are also based on the number of informing 
boreholes and the average distance of all t he informing composites. The average distance 
thresholds for Measured and Indicated blocks are related to the variogram ranges of first and second 
structures, respectively, fitted for copper grades in the Mantos domain.

13.2.3 Minera Ojos del Salado Underground 
 
Minera Ojos del Salado comprises the Santos and Alcaparrosa underground mines. The 2022 
Mineral Resource model update continues to us e the integrated model for the Alcaparrosa, CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 64 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 comprising seven sectors, that was adopted in t he 2018 update. The seven Al caparrosa sectors that 
were modelled separately until 2017 are Alcaparrosa, Caserón 11, North, Northeast, Central, 
Southwest-Southeast-Central East and Viviana. In 20 17, six sectors of the Santos mine, including 
Melendez North, Melendez Central, Melendez South, Supernova, Helena, and Helena Sur, were 
integrated into a single Mineral Resource model. In 2018, the integrated Santos model has been 
expanded to include the areas of Cuerpo Nuevo and Veta Isabel (also known as Malaquita SE). 
 
At the data cut-off date (February 28, 2022), the Alcaparrosa integrated database comprised 1,165 
core boreholes (283,133 metres), including 146 in fill boreholes (35,206 metres) drilled since 2018 
update. For the integrated 2022 Santos  Mineral Resource model, the informing database comprises 
1,604 boreholes (332,210 metres), including 341 infill boreholes (71,200 metres) drilled since 2018 
update. Table 18 presents a summary and estimation st rategy used to build the Mineral Resource 
models for Santos and Alcaparrosa mines. 
 
The methodology used to build the Mineral Resource models for the Santos and Alcaparrosa mines is very similar to what was outlined for the Miner a Candelaria Underground sectors. The compositing 
length (4 metres) and the block size (5- by 5- by 4-metres) are the same as those used for the 
Candelaria Underground North and South sect ors. The main differences include: 
 
 For the Santos mine, drilling information wa s used to interpret geological and grade sections 
that were subsequently used to build fault su rfaces, nine lithological models, and the 0.2% 
and 1.5% copper grade shells using implicit modelling within MineSight software. For the 
Alcaparrosa mine, the drilling information was used directly to build the fault surfaces, 
nine lithological models, and the 0.2% and 1.5% grade shell by implicit modelling within 
Leapfrog software. The Santos and Alcaparrosa block models were coded according to the 
resulting solids. 
 The search for outliers, defined as grades ex ceeding the 97.8 percentile, was restricted to 
7.5 metres for the Alcaparrosa and 15 metres and 7.5 metres for manto and vein mineralization, respectively, for the Santos model. 
 In both the Alcaparrosa and Santos, copper, gold, silver and zinc and magnetite content 
were estimated using the NNK algorithm, wher eas specific gravity was estimated using OK. 
 Between the 0.2% and 1.5% grade shells (med ium grade domain), the lithological units work 
as hard boundaries. However, the lithological solids are treated as soft boundaries outside 
the 0.2% and within the 1.5% grade shells. 
 The 0.2% copper grade shell is considered a soft boundary in the Santos model, but hard in 
the Alcaparrosa model. 
 The estimation of zinc, magnetite content and specific gravity considers only lithological 
domains and treats their contacts as hard boundaries. 
 Similar to the Candelaria models, estimation is performed in two passes. The first pass uses 
a 100- by 100- by 50-metre box search and the second pass uses a search ellipsoid of size and orientation corresponding to the second st ructure of the copper variogram model. A 
minimum of two and a maximum of 16 composites are used to inform the estimation of each 
block within the search volumes. A maximum of  three informing composites per borehole are 
permitted.

SRK Team  February 22, 2023 13.3 SRK Comments 
 
Since acquiring the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex in November 2014, the aggressive 
exploration programs undertaken by LMC have  significantly expanded the Mineral Resource 
estimates of Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos de l Salado. Since the previous Mineral Resource 
model update in 2018, exploration continued in all the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado deposits and 
this led to an increase, in contained copper metal, of about 21% of the global Measured and 
Indicated Mineral Resources, compared to 2018 update. Other factors driving this increase include 
lowering of the reporting cut-off grades. In 2022, the La Española Open Pit cut-off grade was 
reduced from 0.20 to 0.17% copper, and for the underground Mineral Resources, the cut-off grade 
was lowered from 0.55 to 0.40% copper for the Candelaria and from 0.55 to 0.45% copper for the Ojos del Salado. The increase in the Indicated Mineral Resource for the Candelaria Underground 
(North and South sectors) contributes bulk of t he (about 90%) increase in copper metal in 2022. 
 
All of the four models for the underground deposits have now been completely integrated and 
expanded to extend over future areas of explor ation. Since 2017, all new or updated Mineral 
Resource models for Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado have been built by the 
Resource Definition Department of the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex. This centralization has 
resulted in a more consistent Mineral Resource estimation methodology applied to the different 
deposits. The integration of the models and the standardization of the estimation methodology 
across all mines and for most variables repres ents an important milestone that will undoubtedly 
prove helpful for future exploration for the extensio ns of the sulphide mineralization. The success of 
the exploration programs has had a positive impact  on the life of the operations, particularly at the 
underground mines. The Resource Definition Department has a continuous improvement plan in 
place, for the Mineral Resource modelling practice s, as new exploration and production data become 
available. 
 The qualified person is of the opinion that the ex ploration program proposed for the period 2023 to 
2027 has the potential to expand further the Mineral  Resources of the Candelaria Copper Mining 
Complex amenable to both underground and open pit extraction, with a likely positive impact on the 
LOM. 
 
13.4 Mineral Resource Statement 
 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) defines a Mineral 
Resource as: 
 
"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic 
interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic ex traction. The location, quantity, grade or 
quality, continuity and other geological characte ristics of a Mineral Resource are known, 
estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling." 
 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 67 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 According to the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice 
Guidelines (November 2019)  the "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" 
requirement generally implies that the quantit y and grade estimates meet certain economic 
thresholds and that the Mineral Resources ar e reported at an appropriate cut-off grade that 
considers extraction scenarios and processing recoveries.  
 
To demonstrate "reasonable prospects for eventual  economic extraction (RPEEE)", reported open pit 
Mineral Resources have been constrained within t he limit of an optimized pit shell. For reported 
underground Mineral Resources, the spatial contin uity of the mineralization was evaluated using 
different stope volumes with minimum of 2,500 cu bic metres. Volumes of continuous cluster of 
blocks, above different threshold stope volumes,  were compared. The qualified person confirmed 
that 99% of reported underground Mi neral resources are confined to clusters of blocks having 
volume more than 10,000 cubic metre, which woul d satisfy minimum mining volume constraints. 
Mineral Resources are not Miner al Reserves and ha ve not demonstrated economic viability. 
Although the qualified person is satisfied that  the reported Mineral Resources amenable for 
underground extraction satisfy the RPEEE criteria , it is recommended that continuously updated 
constraining volumes be created at each undergro und mine based on operational data to proactively 
manage reported underground Mineral Resources. 
 
There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resource  estimate will be converted into 
Mineral Reserves. 
 
The audited Mineral Resource Statement for Minera Candelaria is presented in Table 20. Open pit Mineral Resources are reported within a conc eptual Lerchs-Grossman pit shell based on metal 
prices of US$4.02 per pound of copper and US$1,6 00 per ounce of gold and at a cut-off grade of 
0.15% copper for the Candelaria Open pit and 0.17% copper for the Española project. Underground 
Mineral Resources from Candelaria Underground (North Sector) and Candelaria Underground 
(South Sector) are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.40% copper.  
 
Table 20 also includes a contribution from variou s operational work-in-progress stockpiles and 
depleted based on actual production until Novemb er 30, 2022 and forecast production for the month 
of December 2022. Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserves.

Mineral Resources include Mineral Reserves. Open pit Mineral Resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.15% copper for the 
Candelaria Open Pit and 0.17% copper for the Española project, wi thin conceptual pit shells bas ed on metal prices of US$4.02 
per pound of copper and US$1,600 per ounce of gold and current topography. Underground Mineral Resources are reported at a 
cut-off grade of 0.40% and 0.45% copper for the Candelaria No rth and South sectors and Ojos  del Salado, respectively.

13.5 Reconciliation 
 
The Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Resource mode l (the Long-Term model) is compared to grade 
control models (the Short-Term model) and to the production reports (as mined) monthly. Grade 
control models are generated from closely spaced blast hole data, whereas Mineral Resource 
models are derived from exploration core drilling data. The tonnages in mine production reports are 
estimated from the number and capacity of trucks op erating in the different mines and the grades are 
taken from the grade control model.  
A monthly reconciliation between the Mineral Resour ce model (Long-Term), the grade control model 
(Short-Term) and As Mined for the Candelaria Open Pi t for the period of June 2018 to June 2022 is 
presented in Table 23. Over that period, the long-term and short-term models are in close 
agreement. The minor decrease in overall tonnes and grade in the short-term model may be due to 
dilution. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 71 
 
 
SRK Team  February 22, 2023 Monthly reconciliation is also undertaken between underground Mineral Resource models (Long-
Term) and Short-Term models, estimated from down -the-hole boreholes sampling, which is used for 
production grade control. Table 24, Table 25 and Table 26 present the monthly reconciliation 
between the Mineral Resources, the grade control models for the Candelaria Underground (North 
Sector), Santos and Alcaparrosa underground mines for the period of July 2018 to December 2020. 
Over that period the long and short-term models for the Candelaria Underground North Sector and 
Alcaparrosa mine are in close agreement, overall. The Santos long-term model, however, is slightly 
optimistic when compared to the short-term model in  terms of copper grades. The larger tonnages 
and lower grades generally reported for the three underground mines in relation to the long-term 
model can largely be attributed to external dilution during mining. 
 
From January 2021 to present, monthly reconciliat ion for Candelaria Underground, Santos and 
Alcaparrosa was halted. CCMC staff plan to re sume tracking monthly reconciliation for these 
sections starting in 2023.

The waterfall charts in Figure 25 summarizes the sources of the changes observed from 
December 2013 to December 2022 in the combined Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for 
Minera Candelaria, Minera Ojos del Salado, and t he entire district plus the stockpiles (WIP). 
 
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources have been steadily increasing since 2014 primarily due 
to the sustained exploration and infill drilling. Duri ng 2017-2020, there was a su bstantial increment in 
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. In 2018, the exploration efforts have resulted in the 
addition of the Española project to Minera Candelaria Mineral Resources and the expansion of the 
Santos and Alcaparrosa Mineral Resource models for Minera Ojos del Salado. The lowering of the 
underground and open pit cut-off grades for both companies in 2022 have resulted in gains that largely exceed the loses of Measured and Indi cated Mineral Resources by depletion. In 2020, 
underground drilling efforts resulted in a significant increase in Mineral Resources for Candelaria UG 
Norte, Alcaparrosa and Santos areas.

14 Mineral Reserve Estimates 
14.1 Commercial Orientation 
 
Mineral Reserves of the CCMC were estimated by the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex Technical Services Open Pit and Underground Departments. The Mineral Reserves are based on the 
December 31, 2022 Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. 
 
The mining costs correspond to the average of the last three years of operating costs of the mine 
and processing plant. Diesel and energy costs were provided by the Company's supplies department 
including sustaining capital and general administration expenses. 
 
The Mineral Reserve estimate is based on the December 2022 LOM production plan. The optimized 
pit design will be mined in Phases 10 through 13 and new design of the Española open pit. The plan includes Candelaria underground North and South sectors and also the Santos mines. Mineralized 
materials from the Alcaparrosa mine have been excluded from the LOM plan and Mineral Reserves 
documented in this Technical Report due to a sinkhole incident which occurred in late 2022.

14.2.1 Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Reserves 
 
The Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Reserve estimates were prepared by the Technical Services Open 
Pit Department and are based on the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. The Mineral Reserve estimates are based on a LOM plan and open pit designs developed using modifying 
parameters including metal prices, metal recovery  based on performance of the processing plant, 
operating cost estimates, and sustaining capita l cost estimates based on the production schedule 
and equipment requirements. 
 
  CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 For the December 31, 2022, Mineral Reserves, si te operating costs used for the pit optimization 
were based on actual average operating costs for the previous three years, 2019 through 2021, and 
long-term forecasts for fuel at US$2.39 per gallon, power at US$0.08 per kilowatt hour, in 
accordance with the forecast LOM average, tire s at US$36,700 and an exchange rate of 700 pesos 
per US dollar. 
 
Base mining costs excluding haulage are estimated at US$1.74 per tonne. St ockpile re-handle costs 
excluding haulage are estimated at US$0.874 per to nne. The haulage increment per 16-metre bench 
is estimated at US$0.026 per tonne per bench to  depth. The fixed milling ore and waste haulage 
costs are estimated at US$0.31 and US$0.64 per tonne, respectively. An equipment annuity of 
US$0.12 per tonne mined was applied to accoun t for equipment replacement. Discounting was 
applied to all block values in the model for the purp oses of pit optimization. The discount rate applied 
was 10.0% and the sinking rate assumed was eight benches per year resulting in an effective 
discount factor of 1.25% per bench.  
Processing cost estimates include US$0.24 per tonne for crushing and US$5.95 per tonne for 
milling. A mill sustaining capita l allowance of US$0.18 per tonne was include d. The general and 
administrative costs of US$2.09 per tonne were assigned to the ore milled. The total processing 
costs are estimated at US$8.45 per tonne milled. 
 
Copper recovery estimates are based on a model developed by the metallurgical group at the 
CCMC. This model takes input data for geology, mineralogy, process throughput, grind size, 
oxidation and zinc to concentrate as part of the pr ocess that provides estimates of final tailings and 
concentrate grades and resultant overall copper recovery. The Candelaria plant average LOM 
copper recovery is estimated to be 90.6%. Gold an d silver recoveries were assigned for a series of 
grade ranges. The average LOM gold and silver recoveries are estimated to be 70.6% and 81.1%, 
respectively. 
 
The copper concentrate is assumed to have a copper  grade of 30.20% with a moisture content of 
9.5%. For the pit optimization, the concentrate wa s assumed to be "clean" with no applicable smelter 
penalties. Transportation costs for the concentrate  are estimated at US$49.50 per wet metric tonne 
or US$54.20 per dry metric tonne. Smelting and refi ning charges are estimated to be US$90.00 per 
dry metric tonne and US$0.09 per payable pound of copper, respectively. Based on a 30.20% 
concentrate grade, the copper pay factor is estimated at 96.5%. 
 
The payable gold in concentrate is estimated at 96.0% with a refining charge of US$5.00 per ounce. 
The payable silver in concentrate is estimated at 90.0% with a silver refining charge of US$0.35 per 
ounce. 
 The pit optimization was undertaken using the Mineral Resource block model expanded in all 
directions to cover the maximum extent of the ultimate pit. A mining block model was populated in 
MineSight and Datamine NPV Scheduler. Additional bl ock model items were added for slope angles, 
concentrate grades, metallurgica l recovery, rock hardness, mini ng restriction near the tailings 
impoundment and the property boundary on the eas t side of the open pit. No additional mining 
dilution or losses were applied to the pit optimizat ion. The average dilution grade factor applied in the CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 81 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 LOM is 3.84% and no loss were applied to the Mineral Reserves. A 100-metre offset pit limit 
restriction was appli ed at the toe of the existing tailings st orage facility. A boun dary restri ction was 
applied on the east side of the open pit. 
 
Open pit wall slope recommendations were provided by Call Nicolas International Company (CNI), 
based on comprehensive geo-mechanical studies to support the current operating pits. Inter-ramp 
slopes angles range from 45 to 57 degrees. Nine sl ope sectors were defined with different inter-ramp 
slope angles, bench face angles, berm intervals, and berm widths (Figure 26). A hard rock surface 
was used to control the slope angle in overburden and fill ar eas in the upper pa rt of the deposit.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The US$3.35 per pound of copper Lerchs-Grossman pit was used as a guide to develop the ultimate 
pit design, which represents revenue fa ctor 0.86. Design parameters include: 
 
 Sixteen-metre bench with double benches between catchment berms. 
 Planned mining widths in the design phases ex ceeding 100 metres but pinching down to 40 
to 60 metres locally where ramps and phase interfaces come together. 
 Haulage allowances of 35 metres; in practice , the ramp width provides adequate room for 
berms and two-way traffic with the 240-tonnne class trucks used at Candelaria. 
 Mining Phases 10 through 13. 
 
The final pit design was used to report the Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Reserves, using a 
topographic profile as of December 31, 2022. The pi t design mining phases are shown in Figure 27. 
For the open pit LOM plan that s upports the open pit Miner al Reserves direct mill feed is scheduled 
at a variable cut-off grade averaging approximately 0.31% copper. The material below that cut-off 
grade but above a grade of 0.15% copper is stockpiled. 
 
 
Figure 27: Candelaria Open Pit Mining Phases

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The updated 2022 overall design has shown a decrease in Mineral Reserves of 7.2% relative to 
2021 of contained copper. The change is primarily due to depletion and new design and a change in 
block model, which has resulted in  a decrease in the overall pit size and material above cut-off. 
 
The open pit mine design has been expanded beyond current environmental permit boundaries. A 
new EIA documentation was submitted in early 2020 and expected to be approved by Q1-2024. 
CCMC considers the permit application approval to be a reasonable expectation. The waste dumps 
have also been expanded beyond current environmental permit boundaries. A new EIA document is 
being prepared for which there is a reasonable expectation of approval. 
 
14.2.2 Española Open Pit Mineral Reserves 
 
The Española project is an addition to the Mineral Reserves in the Candelaria District. The deposit 
will be exploited using open pit mining methods like those currently applied at the Candelaria open 
pit. 
 
The Española project is considered to contain m edium to low grade ore. Its most important 
contribution to the mining plan will be associated with the replacement of ore from low-grade 
stockpiles previously scheduled for processing. 
 
The operating cost estimates used for Española have been adapted from the Candelaria open pit. 
The main differences can be found in mine base costs for a lower mining rate and the transportation 
costs, since these depend entirely on the distance fr om the pit to the dumps, stockpiles and crusher. 
 Mineral Reserves for the Española open pit are based on Measured and Indicated Mineral 
Resources within a pit design defined by the economic limits of mining. 
 
Given certain geological similarities with the cu rrent Candelaria Open Pit, logarithmic regressions 
have been generated, which have been used to estimate the metallurgical copper recoveries. Gold 
and silver recoveries are estimated using the same  criteria as the copper recovery, supported by a 
regression and reduced as copper solubility increases. 
 
Metallurgical recovery for copper, gold and silver were estimated using a similar methodology to Candelaria. In the weathered zone an adjustment  was made to each recovery based upon the 
solubility ratio (copper sulphide: total copper). 
 
The mining base operating cost, excluding haulage,  was estimated at US$1.77 per tonne mined. The 
ore extraction rate will be variable. For the purpo ses of pit optimization, a mining rate of 50 
kilotonnes per day was assumed at Española. 
 Primary loading units in ore and waste will be the Caterpillar 6040 and 6020 backhoes. Stockpile re-
handling, excluding haulage, costs have been estimated at US$ 0.91 per tonne. 
 
The incremental cost per bench (every 8 metr es) has been estimated at US$0.01 per tonne per 
bench. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 84 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 Fixed transportation costs for ore hauled directly to the plant and to the dump are estimated at US$ 
0.85 per tonne and US$ 0.58 per tonne, respectively, and are in line with the latest pit cost estimate. 
CAT 793-F trucks will be t he primary haulage units. 
 
The sustaining capital for equipment amortization has been included at US$0.12 per tonne mined 
and is directly related to equipment replacement and major repairs. This cost has been developed for 
the Candelaria open pit.  
The plant operating cost has been estimated at US$8.45 per tonne and reflects the latest 
adjustments to the Candelaria cost of power. T he plant operating cost includes crushing, grinding, 
general and administrative expenses, plant sustaining capital and an allowance for the Los Diques 
tailings storage facilit y sustaining capital. 
 
The 10% discount rate applied in pit optimization wh ich is the same as the Candelaria pit. The sink 
rate applied was 6 benches per year with a corresponding bench discount factor of 1.67%. 
 
The cut-off grade applied for Mineral Reserve re porting at Española is 0.17% total copper. The 
soluble copper ratio was considered for both pit optimization and Mineral Reserve reporting for 
scheduling. Mineral Resources with  greater than 10% soluble copper were not considered for pit limit 
definition. Mineral Resources with greater than 20 % soluble copper were not reported for Mineral 
Reserves and production scheduling. 
 
A geomechanical pre-feasibility analysis of the Española project design was undertaken by mine site engineers. This review considered the design angles  (i.e. bench face angle (BFA), inter-ramp angle 
(ISA) and containment berm width (CB)). Identificat ion of potential planar failures and/or wedges as 
well as reviewing the geotechnical parameters of the lithology present in the Española deposit was 
completed. 
 
The current Española project design parameters are summarized below: 
 
 Bench face angle (BFA): 70 degrees 
 Inter-ramp slope angle (ISA): 48 degrees 
 Width of berm (BW): 8.6 metres 
 Bench height: 16 metres 
 Ramp width: 35 metres 
 
The design of the Española open pit is mainly in metasedimentary rock (UG30) which shows a high uniaxial compressive strength (UCS between 96 and 167 megapascals). The pit optimization overall 
wall slope was assumed to be 49 degrees. 
 
The Mineral Reserve estimates are based on the mine design developed using an optimized pit limit 
defined by applying the modifying factors describe d above. The positive economics of the Mineral 
Reserves are supported by the financial analysis of the LOM Plan. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 85 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The updated 2022 overall design of the Española has shown an increase in the Mineral Reserves of 
contained copper of 10.4% relative to the 2021 Mineral Reserves. The change is primarily due to an  
updated design, block model, and cut-off due to the di fference in metal prices. The average dilution 
factor applied in the LOM is 3.7% and no loss were applied to the Mineral Reserves. 
 
Environmental permit for the La Española Mineral Re serves extraction is part of EIA 2040. Based on 
the information provided by the EIA team rega rding the anticipated timeframe for the permitting 
process, the environmental permits are expected  be approved by Q1-2024 with the sectorial permits 
in the same year. Extraction of the Española ma terial is currently scheduled to commence in 2024. 
 
14.2.3 Mineral Reserves of the Candelaria Underground Mine 
 The Candelaria Underground mine Mineral Reserve estimates were prepared by the Candelaria 
Copper Mining Complex Underground Technical Se rvice Department. The Mineral Reserves are 
based on the estimated December 31, 2022, Measur ed and Indicated Mineral Resources defined for 
the underground mine.  
 The Candelaria Underground Mine includes bo th the Candelaria Underground North and South 
Sectors. The newly added areas in the North sect or include Consuelo and Cristina. In the South 
sector, the stopes are in the Susana, Mariana and Damiana areas. 
 
The Mineral Reserve estimates for the Candel aria Underground Mine are defined by the 2023 LOM 
plans and the stopes were designed and developed using modifying parameters summarized in 
Table 29.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 It should be noted that mineability factors applied in  2022 were verified based on back-analysis from 
historical mined-out stope cavity monitoring system data. When compared to 2021 Mineral Reserve 
figures (SRK did not audit the 2021 Mineral Rese rves), the Mineral Reserve tonnage has decreased 
by 2.1%, copper grade has decreased by 4.9%, resu lting in contained copper, gold, silver decrease 
by 6.8%, 6.5%, 5.9% respectively. The decre ases are a combination of 2021-2022 production 
depletion, cut-off grade reduction, open pit redesi gn, and the success of the exploration program. 
 The conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Rese rves at Minera Candelaria is initiated at the 
formal transfer of the Mineral Resource block mo dels from the resource modeler to the underground 
mine planning group. 
 
The metal grades of the Inferred Mineral Resources in the Mineral Resource block model were re-
coded to zero. For the Candelaria North sector, preliminary stope layouts were generated by first 
utilizing Deswik Stope Optimizer (DSO) software wi th predefined stope design parameters. These 
preliminary stope designs were reviewed and refined to achieve optimal stope geometries. The 
specific geotechnical recommendations were also  considered for each case including, where 
necessary, for pillars left between the under ground mine and the open pit. The final stope designs, 
grades and tonnes were internally audited before reporting. 
 
Preliminary stope layouts at Candelaria South were also generated by utilizing the DSO with 
predefined stope parameters. These initial designs were reviewed to ensure mineability, after which 
drifting layouts were developed to access the stope s. The mining sequence was scheduled using the 
Deswik software and reviewed to ensure achievabilit y of the plan and considers the interaction with 
the open pit mining sequence. All designs were review ed and confirmed to be outside of the ultimate 
pit design. 
 
Stope in-situ data were reported using an Excel spreadsheet, and mining dilution and recovery 
factors were applied to the final calculations of tonnage and grade. 
 
The cut-off grade calculated for the Candelaria Underground Mine is calculated at a net smelter 
return (NSR) of $31/t, which corres ponds to approximately  0.44% copper after by -product credits, 
was based on 3-year historical costs and Mineral Reserve parameters provided annually by LMC 
corporate to site. 
 
Dilution and recovery parameters vary depending on certain attributes for an individual stope, 
including geotechnical condition, geometry, and location in the mining sequence. 
 
All economical stopes and related development are included in this Technical Report. 
 
14.3 Mineral Reserves of Minera Ojos del Salado 
 
Minera Ojos del Salado consists currently of the Santos underground mine only. The Mineral 
Reserves for the Santos mine were prepared by  the Underground Technical Services Department 
and were based on the estimated December 31, 202 2, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 87 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The Mineral Reserve estimates for the Santos mine are based on their 2023 LOM plans and the 
stopes were designed using modifying parameters tabulated in Table 29. 
The conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Re serves at the Santos mine followed the same 
process applied for the Candelaria Underground Mine. 
 
The cut-off grade calculated for the Santos mine is at NSR of $35/t which correspond to 
approximately 0.51% copper after by-product credit s, was based on 3-year historical costs and 
Mineral Reserve parameters provided annually by LMC corporate to site. 
 
14.4 Mineral Reserve Statement 
 
Mineral Reserves are derived from Measured or Indicated Mineral Resources after applying 
economic parameters. Mineral Reserves ar e classified using the following criteria: 
 
 Proven Mineral Reserves are the Measured Mineral Resources where development work for 
mining and information on processing/metallurgy and other relevant factors demonstrate that 
economic extraction is achievable. 
 Probable Mineral Reserves are those Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources where 
development work for mining and information on processing/metallurgy and other relevant 
factors demonstrate that economic extraction is achievable. 
 
The audited Mineral Reserve Statements for Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado are 
tabulated in Table 30 and Table 31, respectively. The consolidated Mineral Reserve Statement for 
the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is presented in Table 32. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

A comparison of Mineral Reserves reported in June 30, 2021 statement and in December 31, 2022 
statement disclosed in this Technical Report indicate that:  
 The Candelaria Open Pit Mineral Reserves have  decreased by 124 kilotonnes of contained 
copper, considering the extraction from June 2021 through December 2022. 
 The Candelaria WIP shows a decrease of 40 kilotonnes of contained copper due to the 
depletion of the Stockpile in 2022. 
 Candelaria Underground Mineral Reserves have decreased  by 76 kilotonnes of contained 
copper, primarily due to the depletion from June 2021 to December 2022.  
 Ojos del Salado Mineral Reserves have dec reased by 108 kilotonnes of contained copper. 
This reduction is the result of a decrease of  5 kilotonnes from Santos due to production 
depletion and due to the complete removal Mineral Reserves from Alcaparrosa mine which 
was estimated at 103kt based on June 30, 2021 Mineral Reserves statement. 
 Española contributes an additional 25 kilotonnes of contained copper to the Candelaria 
Mineral Reserves in 2022 relative to 2021. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 91 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The Mineral Reserves stated in Table 32 are approx imately 1.1 million tonnes with 0.8 kilotonnes of 
contained copper higher than those included in the LOM plan in Section 15. This is due to 
differences in the actual mine production of 2022 compared to the forecast used in the LOM planning 
for the Mineral Reserves. The qualified persons do no t believe that this change is material to the 
LOM plan. 
 
The Mineral Reserves changes above are based on t he reported Mineral Reserves statements as of 
December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2021. SRK was not involved in the preparation of and has not 
audited the 2021 Mineral Reserves statement.

15 Mining Methods 
15.1 Introduction 
 
Minera Candelaria consists of the Candelaria Open Pit, La Española Open Pit and the Candelaria 
Underground mines. Minera Ojos del Salado consists of the Santos and Alcaparrosa Underground 
mines. In response to a sinkhole that occurred near the Alcaparrosa mine on July 30, 2022 and a 
subsequent infraction notice from the Superint endencia de Medio Ambiente (SMA) alleging four 
environmental permit breaches and a subsequent  request from SERNAGEOMIN for a temporary 
stoppage of the Alcaparrosa mine, mineralized ma terial from the Alcaparrosa mine have been 
excluded from the LOM plan and Mineral Reserves documented in this Technical Report. 
 
The Candelaria and the Minera Ojos del Salado operations are located close to each other, resulting 
in shared surface infrastructure such as the concentrator and tailings dam, as well as a common 
management structure. The ore from the Candelar ia Open Pit, Candelaria Underground is processed 
at the Candelaria processing plant. Ore from the Santos mine is hauled to the PAC processing plant 
located on the Minera Ojos del Salado property. Any ore above the capacity of the PAC plant is sent 
to the Candelaria plant for proc essing. Ore from the Española o pen pit will be transported to the 
Candelaria processing plant. 
 
This section describes the open pit and underground mining methods used at the CCMC. 
 
The open pits will operate with an overall mining rate of approximately 294,000 tonnes per day for 
the next 10 years. As the final Candelaria Phase 13  waste stripping is completed the overall mining 
rate will decline. A stockpile strategy has been de veloped to maximize the grade of material going to 
the processing facility. Direct milling ore will average 0.61% copper from Candelaria and 0.43% 
copper from Española. A lower grade stockpile or e will be recovered to meet plan capacity as 
required. The mine operates five electric shovels and five hydraulic shovels, and will require a fleet of 
55 haulage trucks, seven production drills,  and a fleet of support equipment. 
 
The Candelaria Underground mine has been produci ng a steady state production rate of up to 
14,000 tonnes of ore per day by 2022 as per the LOM plan. The average LOM grade is 0.78% 
copper. The Santos mine will continue to produce at its current rate of production of 5,100 tonnes per 
day of ore to 2025 then decrease to 3,700 tonnes per day of ore from 2026-2033 with an average 
LOM grade of 0.88% copper. The mining method employed in all three underground mines is 
sublevel open stopping. 
 
15.2 Open Pit Mine Design and C onsolidated Production Schedule 
 
A LOM plan for Minera Candelaria is based on the Mineral Reserves reported in Section 14. The14 
plan is largely driven by supplying ore to the C andelaria processing plant from the open pit mine and 
surface stockpiles once the open pit Mineral Reserves have been depleted. The current combined 
open pit Candelaria, open pit Española and work-in-progress stockpile Mineral Reserves are CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 93 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 estimated at 506.9 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.41% copper, 0.10 g/t gold, and 1.32g/t 
silver. The open pit and work-in-pr ogress stockpile Mineral Reserves  are reported at a cut-off grade 
of 0.15% copper for Candelaria and 0.17% copper for Española. 
 
The Candelaria open pit was designed to be mined in several phases of development. As of 
December 2022, four phases of development remain in the LOM plan (Phases 10 to 13). The overall 
strip ratio is expected to be 2.09:1 including ore that is initially deliver ed to stockpiles. The total in-pit 
waste is 753.6 million tonn es and the overall life of the open pit mine is 19 years. The final pit design 
and an outline of the overall Mineral Reserves are shown in Figure 28. The Española total in-pit 
waste is 138.9 million tonnes and the overall life esti mated at 13 years (Figure 29).

The open pit design is based upon the following key considerations: 
 
 Phase development to smooth ore and waste sc heduling with stockpile material available to 
supplement direct mill feed from the mine. 
 Overall and inter-ramp slope recommendations provided by Call Nicolas International 
Company (CNI) including use of  pre-split drilling and blasting. 
 Operating constraints of the equipment available for mining. 
 Minimum mining width defined by double side loading of trucks with allowance for an access 
ramp. 
 Bench height achievable and within the safe operating reach of the primary loading units. 
 Minimum haulage road operating width and maxi mum effective grade within the operating 
limitations of the pr imary haulage units. 
 
The primary components for the open pit slope design include bench geometry, inter-ramp, and 
overall slope angles (Figure 30). The current pit dimensions are 2,500 metres by 2,000 metres with a 
depth of 790 metres. Current inter-ramp slope angles  range from 45 to 50 degrees in the west wall 
and from 52 to 57 degrees in the east wall. Bench face angles range from 65 to 78 degrees.

The rock at Candelaria has a typical uniaxial co mpressive strength of over 140 megapascals and is 
considered "hard rock". With resp ect to the instabilities, the most  complex ones develop on the East 
and Southeast wall, being of the planar failure and wedge type, while on the west wall it is strongly

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 influenced by the fault LAR and the intersections wi th the different structural systems, likewise in 
north wall the failures are associated with rock mass conditions and the interaction with the water 
flows coming from the tailings (especially in the northwest sector). Open wall slope 
recommendations have been provided by CNI. 
 
Slope monitoring is carried out in the mine on a continuous basis using robotized monitoring 
systems, including two robotic prism monitoring st ations Leica TM60 (100 prism), one SlideMinder 
extensometers, three Ground Probe SS radar units  and two Ibis Radar, eight vibrating wire 
piezometers, and three web cameras. 
 
The Candelaria Open Pit is relatively dry owing to its location in an arid region. The northeast wall 
appears to be receiving some seepage from the toe of the tailings dam. Horizontal drain holes have 
been drilled up to 400 metres into the wall to reduce pore pressures in the area of the Lar fault. 
 The pit designs include allowances for 32- to 35-metre-wide roads including ditches and berms. Haul 
roads within the pit limits have a maximum gradient of 10%. The final pit design is shown in 
Figure 28. The flowsheet for the design and scheduli ng of the Minera Candelaria LOM plan is shown 
in Figure 31.

The LOM plan was developed using MineSight and Datamine NPVS software packages. The Mineral 
Resource model and standard mining block model were developed in MineSight. This standard 
mining model was then imported to NPVS to calculate economic value items and to develop Lerchs-
Grossman pit limits. A final pit design was de veloped in MineSight. NPVS was used to develop 
potential pushback limits. Detailed phase designs were then completed in MineSight, and schedule 
optimization was under taken in NPVS. Once a cut-off grade wa s estimated and a stockpile strategy 
was completed, MineSight Schedule Optimizer wa s used to create the final detailed schedule.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The mine production schedule for Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado for the period 2023 
to 2046 shown in Table 33, displays the material sent to the Candelaria and PAC plants, and the 
forecast processing plant recoveries together wi th the concentrate and contained copper, gold, and 
silver metals. The LOM plan was prepared based on the actual production up to May 2022 and 
included production forecast for the remaining year 2022. The Mineral Reserves stated in Table 32 
are approximately 1.1 million tonnes with 0.8 kilo tonnes of contained copper higher than those 
included in the LOM plan. This is due to differenc es in the actual mine production of 2022 compared 
to the forecast used in the LOM planning for the Mineral Reserves. The qualified persons does not 
believe that this change is material to the LOM pl an. Low grade material from the open pit is initially 
transferred to WIP stockpiles and later withdraw n as WIP re-handle feed for the plant. The current 
mine production forecast is shown graphically in Figure 32. Examples of annual development plans 
are shown in Figure 33 to Figure 36. Española is expected to begin ore delivery to the Candelaria 
processing plant during the second half of 2026. 
 For 2023, the CCMC is forecasted to produce concen trates containing 145-155 kilotonnes of copper, 
85-90 kilo-ounces of gold and 1.37 million ounces of silver. Over the remaining LOM plan (2024 to 
2046), the average annual production is estimated to be 122 kilotonnes of copper, 72 kilo-ounces of 
gold and 1.2 million ounces of silver. Over the 10-year period, 2024-2033, the average annual 
production is estimated to be 150 kilotonnes of copper, 86 kilo-ounces of gold and 1.4 million ounces 
of silver.

15.3 Underground Mine Design and Production Schedule 
 
Each of the three underg round mines and its associated facilities is acce ssed by a surface portal 
and ramp. Figure 37, Figure 38, and Figure 39 show  the basic layout of Candelaria Underground 
(North Sector), Candelaria Underground (South Sector), and the Santos mine, respectively. 
 
The underground mine Technical Services Group employs geological, geotechnical, planning and 
surveying personnel. The mines follow detailed production and development plans and schedules, 
with the mining activities conducted under the guidance and oversight of the Technical Services' 
Director. 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 105 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The operational activities at the mines are largely performed by contractors with oversight by Minera 
Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado management. At Candelaria Underground, both North and 
South sectors, the owner's team  is responsible for production loading and hauling operations. In 
addition, production drilling at Sout h sector has re cently been internalized  and performed by CCMC. 
The contractors employ and manage the mines' labour force and they own and maintain the mining 
equipment for the areas for which they are responsible.

The underground mines are relatively dry owing to t heir location in an arid region. Geotechnical rock 
mass characterization was completed from core l ogging, detailed mapping of geological structures, 
testing of intact material properties and measur ing in-situ stresses. Empirical open stope design 
methodologies were used to determine roof and wa ll stability and the size of pillars. Numerical 
analysis simulation tools for mine sequencing analysis were also applied.

The authors of this Technical Report are of the opinion that the stopes that  support the proposed 
LOM plan for the Candelaria and Santos under ground mines can be mined as expected. 
 
The flowsheet for the design and scheduling of the underground Mineral Reserves in the mine plan 
is shown in Figure 40. The two underground mines utilize a sublevel open stoping mining method for 
ore extraction. This method is ideal for relative ly large, vertical, thick deposits with favourable 
(stable) host rock (Figure 41). 
 
Stope excavations can typically be up to 180 metres high with sublevels at 20 to 60 metre intervals. 
The length of the stopes ranges from 40 to 100 metres, with widths varying between 20 to 
30 metres. A Redbore RB50 or down-the-hole (DTH) drill is used to create a slot at one end of the 
stope, which will provide the relief necessary when blasting commences. Stope blastholes are 
drilled downwards from the sublevel drilling drifts as benches, using 114-to-130-millimetre diameter 
holes. The holes are loaded and blasted in vertical slices towards the open face created by the slot 
blasting. The blasted ore gravitates to the bottom of  the stope and is collected in draw points at the 
production level below. This lower level also  consists of the haulage (transport) drift.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The undercut levels, which feed the draw points, are 15 to 20 metres high and inclined at 50 to 
60 degrees to allow the blasted ore to flow easily by gr avity. An Epiroc Simba top hammer rig drills 
64-millimetre up holes within the undercut, which are loaded and blasted with the down holes. Once 
the stope is mined, a remaining rib pillar, which can be another 20 to 30 metres wide, may be 
blasted into the stope to increase the extraction tonnage. Typically, a 20-metre structural pillar 
remains between each stope and no backf ill is used at these operations. 
 
Ore is mucked from the draw points using surf ace-type front-end loaders and load-haul-dump (LHD) 
vehicles. The mucked ore is dumped into 37-tonne,  highway-type trucks and hauled up the ramp to 
a surface stockpile for subsequent re-handling and processing. At Can delaria Underground, the 
highway-style trucks have been replaced with  60-tonne low-profile articulated trucks. 
 
Some mineralized material may not be recoverable at stope completion, while other mineralized 
material is left as support pillars , lowering the overall mining reco very. The overall mining recovery 
varies depending on the type of stope and its geom etry. The amount of dilution also varies 
depending on the stope setting. Dilution typically contains mineralized material with low metal 
grades. Typical mining recovery and dilution factors are tabulated in Table 34.

 A Scoping Study to determine the economic viability of adding cemented paste tailings backfill to the 
underground workings, in anticipation of providing greater extraction tonnages, was completed in 
2019. The results of the study showed that recove ring remnant supporting pillars is potentially 
viable. However, this option has been put on hold and not prioritized for further investigation as the 
district still has a long mine life. 
 
15.4 Underground Mine Plan 
 
The current scheduled annual production for the Candelaria Underground (North and South 
Sectors) and Santos mines is summarized in Table 35. 
 The Candelaria Underground mine is planned 14,000 ore tonnes per day by approximately 10,000 
tonnes and 4,000 tonnes from North and South sectors, respectively . The combined production from 
both sectors will allow the mine to maintain this  peak production up until 2046. Between 2029-2037, 
production from the Candelaria South will tem porarily be stopped due to the interaction with the 
open pit. The underground mining activities in the South sector will resume once the open pit is 
complete. During this stoppage period production from the standalone Candelaria North is planned 
to sustain the production rate of 14,000 tonnes per day.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 Candelaria operations currently uses an existi ng portal located on the 416-pit bench to access the 
underground mine. The North and South Sectors ar e connected through the East Ramp. There are 
two new ramps currently under construction for fu ture accesses: the South Ramp and 544L Portal 
and Ramp. 
 
The South Ramp is located in the South, outsi de of the open pit area, and is intended to be a 
haulage route for the South Sector and an alternat ive emergency egress for the sectors. This ramp 
was completed by the end of 2022. The new 544L portal is located inside the ultimate pit limit. This 
ramp is a replacement for the existing 416L portal and scheduled to be in service in early 2023.

The Santos mine will maintain its current production rate of approximately 5,100 tonnes per day until 
2025. Production will decrease to 3,700 tonnes per day from 2026-2033 and ends in year 2034. This 
will be achieved by developing 400 metres per month until 2025 when the development rate will be 
reduced gradually. The development rate varies from 200 to 100 metres per month from 2026 to 
2031. 
 
15.5 Waste Dumps 
 
The capacity of each of the waste dumps is su mmarized in Table 37. The waste dump surface area 
will be increased with the new waste dumps El Buitre and Sur-Sur by approximately 775 hectares 
with an expanded capacity of approximately 1,020 million tonnes. The dumps will be constructed in 
20-metre lifts and 32-metre-wide access ramps. 
  
The waste dump remaining capacity at Nantoco as of Oct 31, 2022, was 265 million tonnes. The 
North and Buitre dumps had 200 and 790 million-tonne capacities, respectively. The LOM plan 
shows a total waste production of 892 million tonnes, 753 million tonnes from the Candelaria Open 
Pit and 139 million tonnes from Española, indicating  that the dump designs available now are not 
sufficient for the current LOM plan. However, fo r this purpose, new EIA documentation is being 
prepared, adding more lifts in the Nantoco and Bu itre waste dumps, for which there is a reasonable 
expectation of approval. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

15.6 Mine Equipment 
 
15.6.1 Open Pit Mine Equipment 
 The Candelaria Open Pit is a conventional truck and shovel operation. The unit operations are 
drilling, blasting, grade control, loading and hauli ng. The primary loading units are electric cable 
shovels; however, the sustaining capital plan does  allow for a gradual implementation of hydraulic 
loading units. The primary drills are rotary di esel-powered units. Support equipment provides 
development access, road maint enance and equipment servicing capability. The open pit mine 
operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Shift employees work 12-hour shifts. The overall 
mining rate for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is approximately 205,000 tonnes per day for 
the next 23 years. Total primary crusher throug hput is variable based upon hardness averaging 
76,800 tonnes per day combined open pit and underground ore. 
 
The primary production blasthole drills are rotary  machines capable of single pass drilling on a 16-
meter bench. The current drill fleet consists of seven PV-351 diesel units. Drill mechanical availability 
for the fleet averages 80% and utiliz ation averages 80%. Drill penetration rates are variable ranging 
from 15 metres per hour in ultra- hard rock to 30 metres per hour in  ultraweak rock. The fleet will be 
expanded to a total of 10 drills over the next year including 7 Pit Vipers and 5 Roc drills for wall 
control blasting. 
 
The rock at the Candelaria Open Pit is hard and fine fragmentation is requir ed in most areas of the 
pit to maximize throughput to the concentrator. As a result, drill patterns are relatively tight resulting 
in powder factors ranging from 0.50 to 0.75 kilogram per tonne.  
The wall control blasting includes line holes drilled for presplitting. There are five Atlas Copco Roc L8 
drills dedicated to line hole drilling. The line holes  are normally drilled on 2-metre centres at the 
recommended bench face angle on a double bench. 
 
Blasting is carried out with heavy ammonium nitrat e / fuel oil. Blasthole cuttings are sampled and 
assayed for copper only for grade control.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The primary loading fleet currently consists of  two P&H 4100 (43 cubic metres), three P&H 2800 
(28 cubic metres) electric cable shovels. A PC 5500 (12 cubic metres) hydraulic excavator is also 
being used in narrow operating areas. Rental unit s are planned in the short term until new machines 
can be delivered. Support units include two Cat 994F (16 cubic metres) and one Cat 994K (9 cubic 
metres) wheel loader. The P&H 4100 and P&H 2800 shovels mine stockpiles, ore, and waste. The 
CAT 6020 re-handles ore from the Candelaria Underg round North Sector to large haulage trucks for 
transportation to the primary crusher. The shov el fleet has an average availability of 81% and 
utilization of 80%.  
 
Under a major mine equipment re-c apitalization program, new hydr aulic excavators/shovels will 
replace the cable shovels, during 2024. A P&H 4100 electric shovel will be replaced, and a new CAT 
6060 hydraulic shovel will be acquired for the La Española project.  
 
The Minera Candelaria haulage fleet currently cons ists of 55 Cat 793F mechanical drive trucks. 
These trucks use light boxes and typically ca rry loads of between 232 and 237 tonnes. Road 
conditions in the mine are very good and the tire life is 90,000 kilometres. A truck rebuild program is 
also in place at the Candelaria Open Pit, and trucks are overhauled at 100,000 hours with an 
extended life expectancy of 75,000 hours. The truck fl eet availability is 87% and utilization is 86%. 
Loading times for the trucks range from 10.0 minutes with a PC2000 to 1.6 minutes with a P&H 
4100. The truck fleet requirement in the LOM plan is expected to peak at 60 units. Rebuilds are 
planned for 14 Cat 793C trucks; four in 2021, 2022 and 2023 and two in 2024, while the remainder 
of the fleet will be phased out and replaced with newe r technology Cat 793F trucks; however, the Cat 
793F trucks will also be rebuilt. The LOM plan assumes 6 trucks will be rebuilt between 2029 to 2035. A total of 38 new trucks will be purchased over the next four years under the mine equipment 
re-capitalization program. 
 
The open pit mine has an extensive fleet of support equipment. The track dozer fleet includes six Cat 
D10 and two Cat D11 models, which are used on dumps, stockpiles, and in the pit for bench 
maintenance. Under the re-capit alization program this dozer fleet will be upgraded with newer 
models. There are five Cat 824-wheel dozers for road and bench maintenance. In the future, Cat 
834-wheel dozers will be introduced. The grader  fleet includes three Cat 16M and one Cat 24M 
models. Replacements for graders are also planned. 
 
The mine support equipment fleet includes five Cat 773 and one Cat 777 water trucks for watering 
roads and working faces prior to loading to control dust. Replacement Cat 777G water trucks are 
planned. The excavator fleet includes two Cat 385 mo dels that are used for wall scaling and ditching 
as required. 
 
A dispatch system is used in t he mine. High precision GPS locators are used on shovels and drills. 
Lower precision systems are used on trucks and auxiliary equipment. 
The open pit mine major equipment additions and replacements under the four-year mine 
recapitalization program are summarized in Table 38.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 15.6.2 Underground Mine Equipment 
 
All two underground mines utilize conventional surface and underground equipment designed for 
hard-rock mining environments. LHDs and front-end loaders are used for mucking ore from the stope draw points and development headings. Several of the LHDs have remote-control capability, which 
allows the unit to travel past the brow and incr ease ore recovery, whereas the front-end loaders do 
not. Blasted ore is mucked into 45-tonne, highway -type trucks at Santos and 60-tonne underground 
haul trucks at Candelaria, which transport the mu ck to a surface stockpile. For production ore, 
typically three to four trucks are assigned to  one loader depending on the haul distance. For stope 
drilling, down-the-hole drills with 114 to 130-millimetre diameter bits are used in the sublevels. Atlas 
Copco Simba top hammer drills are utilized for draw  point drilling. Twin-boom jumbos drill off the 
development headings and drill holes for installing the bolts used for ground support. Aerial-lifts are 
used for the installation of services and bolts.  
The overall mining rate is currently 14,000 t onnes per day for the Candelaria Underground mine The 
mine will maintain this peak production rates until year 2046. Ore production from the Santos mine 
will be at 5,100 tonnes per day until 2025 and will ramp down to 3,700 tonnes per day until 2033 and 
conclude in 2034 with an average production rate of 1,300 tonnes per day. 
 
The primary mining equipment currently used at the Candelaria Underground and Santos mines is 
summarized in Table 39. At the Candelaria Underground mine, Minera Candelaria owned and 
operated loading and hauling equipment which are ma inly consists of 17-tonne LHDs and 60-tonne 
underground haul trucks. 
 
All underground mining equipment at Santos and most  of the development and support equipment at 
Candelaria underground are owned and operated by contractors. The equipment fleet will remain 
constant for the next couple of years as t he mine has reached a steady state production.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 15.7 Mining Opportunities 
 
Continued exploration programmes and open pit re-optim izations have been successful in increasing 
the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves at t he Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, resulting in 
a significant increase in the complex's operating life, particularly in the two underground mines. In 
anticipation of further positive exploration resu lts continuing to enlarge the Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves, the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex continues examining potential mine 
expansion options. 
 
Since the mine has achieved its production objec tive of 14,000 tonnes per day, studies are 
continuing both Candelaria Underground North and S outh sectors with a view to further increase 
production levels. A Feasibility Study for Candelaria Underground Expansion was completed in 2020 
and updated in 2021. The expansion was intended to increase total throughput from Candelaria 
underground to 26,000 tonnes per day. The expansion project is currently under basic engineering 
stage and will be further evaluated once the changes in the Chilean tax regime and mining royalties 
are finalized.

16 Recovery Methods 
 
CCMC operates two processing plants: Candelaria PAC. The Candelaria processing plant receives ore from Candelaria open pit, Candelaria Undergro und North and South Sector, currently suspended 
Alcaparrosa and part of Santos underground mi nes. The PAC processing plant receives ore 
exclusively from the Santos mine. 
 
16.1 Minera Candelaria Plant 
 
The Minera Candelaria plant is a mature operation th at started producing in 1995. It has a nominal 
capacity of 75,000 tonnes per day of fresh f eed and produces a copper concentrate with gold and 
silver credits. Additionally, CCMC has an agreement  with Compañía Minera del Pacifico S.A. (CMP) 
to process Candelaria's flotation tails and recove r a magnetite concentrate for which CCMC receives 
some of the revenues associated, as an additional by-product credit. 
 
In 2020, CCMC initiated the CMOP phase 3 to in crease concentrator throughput by an expected 
2,000 tonnes per day. This project scope included conversion of the existing ball mill N°6 to rod 
milling, will allow all the crushed and milled pebbles to advance towards secondary grinding, 
liberating room for incremental fres h feed to SAG milling. The project is expected to be completed in 
September 2023. 
 
16.1.1 Processing Flowsheet 
 Minera Candelaria operates a conventional plant fl owsheet incorporating crushing, two parallel lines 
of grinding and copper flotation with final conc entrate filtration and shipping to the port at Punta 
Padrones. Process water is reclaimed from t he tailings storage facility after thickening and 
deposition. Figure 42 shows the complete Minera Candelaria process flowsheet with Table 40 
tabulating major equipment and their sizes. 
 
Run-of-mine ore is trucked to a primary gyratory  crusher. The crushed product is transported using 
an overland conveyor belt to a coar se ore stockpile with a total capacity of 500,000 tonnes. Semi-
autogenous grinding mills are followed by ball mills with crushing of the SAG mill generated pebbles. 
A portion of the crushed pebbles are sent to a dedica ted grinding mill, with the remainder retuned to 
the SAG mills. The ball mills are operated in closed -circuit with hydrocyclones ahead of flotation. 
 
A multi-stage flotation circuit using an arrangement  of mechanical cells, regrind mills and column 
cells produces a final copper concentrate with gold a nd silver credits. Final concentrate is thickened, 
filtered and stored on site before being transported to Minera Candelaria's shipping port at Punta 
Padrones, near Caldera. Final flotation tails are thickened and disposed of in a rockfill embankment 
tailings storage facility.

16.1.2 Historical Performance 
 The average annual throughput of Minera Candel aria from 2005 to late 2022 was 26 Mtpa, 
equivalent to 70,800 tonnes per day at a plant utiliz ation of 92% as shown in Figure 43. Production 
dropped to 21.6 Mtpa in 2020 due to a 36-day strike. 
 
Between 2005 and late 2022, copper, gold and silver recoveries averaged 93%, 72% and 83% 
respectively (see Figure 44). Feed copper grade ha s steadily dropped from 0.9% to a range of 0.5% 
to 0.6% from 2016 onwards. CCMC's plant avail ability has been very steady from 2005 to 2021 at 
between 91% and 96% with an average of 93.5% (see Figure 45). 
 
The average concentrate grade since 2019 was 30% copper. The Candelaria processing plant 
produces a clean concentrate containing no penalty elements with payable gold and silver. Gold 
content in the concentrate has b een consistently 5 to 6 g/t with silver between 80 to 100 g/t. Zinc 
grades in the concentrate since 2019 aver aged 0.6%, which is below penalty levels.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 16.1.4 Magnetite Recovery 
 
Since 2008, tailings from the Minera Candelaria  processing plant have been treated under an 
agreement with CMP to produce a saleable mag netite concentrate. The CMP magnetite recovery 
plant is located to the west of the Candelaria plant site area and south of the old tailings storage 
facility. Magnetite concentrate from the plant is transferred via pipeline to  CMP's port near Caldera 
and the remaining non-magnetic material is deposited in the Candelaria tailings storage facility. 
 Magnetite concentrate provides an additional source  of by-product revenue to CCMC, subject to 
global iron ore prices and as a result, may vary in  the future. The contractual agreement includes 
payment for rental of the CMP plant site area from CCMC. To reach an approved iron concentrate 
production rate of 3 Mtpa, CMP can process mate rial other than Candelaria tailings but must pay a 
per tonne fee for the disposal of third-party tails  as part of the agreement. The Candelaria mine 
production plan includes 1.3 to 1.8 million tonne s of annual magnetite content until 2035, with a 
magnetite iron content of 6.5 to 11.9%. 
 
16.1.5 Candelaria Forecasted Performance 
 
Figure 46 shows forecasted feed sources and average copper grades for the Candelaria process 
plant. This forecast includes the expected outco mes of CMOP Phase 3 and Candelaria Underground 
Expansion Plan (CUGEP). Copper head grades will remain between 0. 5% to 0.7% until 2035 before 
falling to below 0.4% at the end of mine life. Recl aimed stockpiles and Candelaria Underground will 
be the only mill feed source at the end of mine life.

Figure 48 shows forecasted copper recovery and final concentrate grades. Copper recovery is 
expected to drop after 2041 as stockpiled materi al becomes a greater percentage of plant feed. 
Copper mineralogy is not expected to change and co nsequently, forecasted copper in concentrate is 
very stable.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 16.2 Minera Ojos del Salado PAC Plant 
 
The PAC concentrator of Minera Ojos del Salado has been in operation since 1929. The 
concentrator processes 3,800 tonnes per day from the Santos underground mine with an average 
head grade of 0.85% copper and copper recovery of 94%. Copper concentrate produced has 
averaged 30% copper, 5 g/t gold and 67 g/t silver since 2004. Gold and silver recoveries are slightly 
lower than Candelaria, at 72% each. The current  mine plan shows the PAC plant continuing to 
operate at this capacity until 2034, when it will halt production. 
 
The concentrator flowsheet comprise s a closed-circuit crushing plan t including a primary jaw crusher 
(48 by 60 inches), a secondary cone crusher (S ymons 7-foot standard) and two tertiary cone 
crushers (Symons 7-foot short head). Figure 49 shows the current PAC process flowsheet. 
 
The grinding circuit includes three ball mills (one Marcy 9 ft x 9 ft and two Allis-Chalmers 10.5 ft x 13 
ft) operating in parallel, in closed-circuit with hy drocyclones. The flotation plant uses multi-stage, 
mechanical (self-aspirated and forced air) flotation cells varying in size from 100 to 1500 cubic feet. 
After rougher flotation, regrind milling and column cells are used to generate a final concentrate 
which is thickened and filtered using a 322 ft2 (30 m2) ceramic disc filter. Final flotation tailings from 
the PAC plant are pumped to the Los  Diques tailings storage facility. 
 
16.2.1 Historical Performance 
 Table 42 shows the PAC plant capacity since 2018. The average plant capacity since 2018 is 
3,539 tonnes per day with a plant availability of 94.6%. Copper concentrate produced averaged 
28.7%. Average copper production is equivalent to 12,413 tonnes per year. Table 43 shows PAC 
plant consumables.

16.3 Candelaria Plant Expansion Projects 
In 2017, CCMC initiated a feasibility study to ev aluate potential expansion of the main processing 
complex. The feasibility study was conducted after successful expl oration programs resulted in 
discovering additional mineral resources and reserv es leadi ng to increased mine life for CCMC. The 
results of this 2017 study did not demonstrate a suffici ent return to justify this expansion as mo st of 
the incremental throug hput increase was from ac celerated processing of low-grade, stockpiled 
material. 
The plant expansion as outlined in the feasibilit y study was not advanced furt her but some of the 
process improvement initiatives highlighted were in cluded in the CMOP. The aim of these initiatives 
was to improve metallurgical performance from increased throughput by 4,000 tonnes per day (5% 
higher) and an addition al 1.7% copper recovery. These initiatives were planned in 2018 and later 
renamed "CMOP Phase 1", are summarized in Tabl e 44 at a total estimated cost of US$73.9M. 
Some of these initiatives were delayed due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with 
completion dates included in Table 44.

17.2 Power Supply 
Powe
r for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, as  well as the port and desalination facilities, is 
supplied under a contract with AES Andes S.A.  since 2012. Contract term extension and CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 133 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 negotiations have recently been completed until 2035. An extension agreement was reached with a 
significant price reduction. Power maximum capacity of 139 megawatts and the option to increase to 
160 megawatts. 
Starting in 2023, at least 80% of the supply will be from green sources (r enewable energy). Typical 
combined maximum demands for the mines, port, and desalination plant are approximately 
110 megawatts. Under the newly signed power contract, the unit power cost is forecast to decrease 
to approximately US$0.07 per kilowatt hour from 2026. 
In 2021, Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado consumed 775 and 71 gigawatt hours, 
respectively, for a combined total of 846 gigawatt hours per year. Reported power costs in 2021 and 
2022 year to date were US$0.109 and US$0.143 per kilowatt hour respectively. 
17.3 Punta Padrones Port Facilities 
17.3.1 Background 
Minera Candelaria inf
rastructure in cludes the Punta Padrones port fa cilities located at Caldera on the 
Pacific Ocean seaboard (Figure 52). It has been in operation since 1995. The fac ility comprises a 
covered concentrate warehouse with a capacity of 45,000 wet metric tonnes and a telescopic ship 
loader that has a ca pacity of 1,000 wet metric tonnes per hour. The facility is equipped with dust 
collection systems and all concentrate truck discha rge and warehouse loader activities take place 
inside covered buildings. The telescopic ship loader is PLC controlled and conveyor discharge to the ship hold is via an "elephant's trunk." 
The port is able to accommodate ships of up to 58,000 metric tonnes with drafts of up to 12.4 
metres. Typically, three vessels are loaded per month.  The total capacity of the port is approximately 
3.5 million wet metric tonnes per  annum. The maximum annual concentrate production over the 
remaining LOM is approximately 60 0,000 wet metric tonnes per annum . Overall utilization of the port 
is therefore low and the excess capacity is potentia lly available for cost savings and sharing with 
other concentrate exporters. 
Figure 52: Aerial view of th e Punta Padrones Port Facility 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 134 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 17.3.2 Logistics 
Most of the coppe
r concentrate pr oduced at the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is transported 
by truck to the Port of Punta Padrones. On occasi on, material is delivered by  truck to customers in 
the Atacama Region. 
The Port of Punta Padrones, owned and operated  by the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is 
located 110 kilometres away from mine in Caldera Bay. Upon arrival at the port complex, trucks are weighed in full before unloading and weighed empty 
after. The concentrate is discharged into a chute in side the receiving building. The material is moved 
from the receiving area to the storage wa rehouse by a conveyor belt system. 
Once the vessel is accessed to the loading berth, t he concentrate is retrieved from the stockpile with 
a front-end loader and placed onto a conveyor belt. Material flowing over the belt is weighed and 
samples are taken automatically as prescribed. 
For loading tasks, the port has a mobile loader t hat moves along the ship, which makes loading more 
efficient. In addition, it is provided with a telescopic chute that goes into the hold of the ship. All this 
work is done from the deck, using a remote-control console. 
17.4 Fresh Water Supply 
Histo
rically, the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex sourced fresh water from deep wells in the 
nearby Copiapó aquifer for which the mines held and continue to hold water rights. During the 2000s, 
water levels in many of these wells dropped significantly and some went dry. 
Following an extensive examination of alternative water supplies, including more distant ground 
water wells, Minera Candelaria opted to construc t a desalination plant at  the Punta Padrones port 
site and pump the water 110 kilometres to the mine site via a dedicated pipeline and booster pump station (Figure 53). The desalination plant was or iginally designed at 300 litres per second and was 
later expanded to 500 litres per second. 
The desalination plant itself consists of three, nominal 150-litre-per-second lines comprising pre-
filtration, ultra-filtration, micro-filtration ahead of  conventional reverse osmo sis. The reverse osmosis 
plant includes 468 pressure vessels with 3,276 membranes operating at a pressure exceeding 1,000 pounds per square inch. The desalination plant was commissioned in early 2013 and reached 
nameplate capacity later that year. In November 2013, extraction from groundwater sources in the 
Copiapó aquifer was stopped, except for wa ter for potable supply and emergencies. 
The water requirements can be met by pumping addi tional desalinated seawater from the plant at 
Punta Padrones. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

17.5 Ojos Pipeline Relocation 
To ensure op
erational continuity of the PAC plant, after the expiry of the Candelaria tailings storage 
facility in 2019, a new tailin gs pipeline was built in 2019 to carry the tailings to the Los Diques tailings 
facility. The project was completed in January 2020. 
17.6 Tailings Storage Facilities 
17.6.1 Los Diques Tailings St orage Facility (Active)  
The Los Diques TSF is designed to provi
de 600 million tonnes (Mt) of tailings storage capacity based 
on an average mine process throughput of 75,000 to nnes per day (Figure 54). The design includes 
10 growth phases (Phases 0 to 9) with a final dam crest elevation of 873 metres above sea level (for 
an approximate overall dam height of 160 metres). The dams are currently between Phases 3 and 4. 
The Phase 9 design provides tailings storage capacity until around 2040. Conceptual design 
evaluations have been completed to expand the Los Diques TSF beyond 2040. 
CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 136 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 Los Diques TSF is conceptually designed as a "zer o discharge" facility. Other main design criteria 
include: 
Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) is fully contained within the tailings impoundmen t, leaving a
minimum fre
eboard of 3 metres

Dams are designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake (M CE)

Minimum operational freeboard of 5 metr es
The Lo
s Diques TSF includes three dams (Main, North and South), a tailings distribution system 
(TDS), water recovery system (RWS), and an infiltra tion collection system (SCS). All three dams are 
constructed with the downstream construction method. The Main Dam is constructed with 
permeable, compacted rockfill (mine waste rock). A trans ition layer, filter layer and a filter protection 
layer are placed on the upstream slope of the dam. A se ries of finger drains underlay the Main Dam. 
The purpose of these finger drains  is to collect seepage from t he tailings impoundment and direct 
this seepage to the seepage collection system described below. The dam is designed to be 
permeable and to collect seepage from the tailings impoundment, to maximize water recovery. 
The South and North Dams are constructed with compacted rockfill. The upstream slopes of these 
dams are lined with a geomembrane placed over a b edding layer. The plinths of these dams are tied 
to bedrock. A grout curtain is installed beneath the plinths. These dams are designed to limit 
seepage migration. The Los Diques TSF receives flotation tailings from  both the Candelaria and PAC processing plants. 
The Candelaria flotation tailings are thickened and pumped at an average solids content of about 
50%. The Minera Ojos del Salado flotation tailings are pumped at an average solids content of about 
35%. 
The current Los Diques closure plan concept includ es a dry cover and a spillway on the North Dam 
that will direct surface run-off to a drainage ca nal located on the west boundary of the dam. Water 
that is collected in the drainage canal will be routed to the pit. 
17.6.2 Candelaria Tailings Storage (Inactive) 
The inactive 
Candelaria TSF is located to the nor th-west of the open pit (F igure 4). This facility 
received tailings from the Candelaria processing plant between 1994 and 2019. This facility has 
three embankment dams (Main, North and South), cons tructed with mine waste material with a final 
designed crest elevation of 800 metres above sea le vel. Construction of the final dam configuration 
was completed in 2015. The dams have a filter system comprised of varying combinations of 
granular material, geotextile and/or geomembrane liner on the upstream slope. The downstream 
slope of the dams is 1.6H:1V and the upstream slo pe is 1.8H:1V. All dams were constructed using 
the downstream method. 
The Candelaria TSF will ultimately be closed and reclaimed in accordance with the approved closure 
concept. The currently approved closure concept was developed in 2015 and contemplates 
construction of a 0.3-metre thick rockfill closure c ap, plus storm water management features that CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 137 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 would include runoff control ditching, a storm water surge pond on the concave shaped tailings 
impoundment surface, plus an emergency overflow spillway. 
An alternative closure concept, cu rrently under considerati on, includes a thicker rockfill closure cap 
that can be expanded to also provide additional st orage capacity for waste rock disposal during on-
going mine operations. This alternative closure co nfiguration would be progressively developed in 
stages as the waste rock becomes available for c apping. Construction of the new waste rock storage 
area within the Candelaria tailings impoundment area would be staged and sequenced to 
consolidate and stabilize the underlying tailings mass, thus en hancing the overal l stability and 
security of the closed facility and thus minimizing  the long-term risk relating to the closed TSF. 
Figure 54: Los Diques Tailings Storage Fac ility, August 2022 (Looking North-West) 
Source: Minera Candelaria 
The wa
ste rock pile would allow the area to be transitioned into a stable mounded landform that 
allows storm water drainage to be routed around the facility, thus remo ving the requirements for 
water storage and an overflow spillway  from the TSF after closure.

SRK Team February 22, 2023 18 Market Studies and Contracts 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex has been selling copper sulphide concentrates to 
customers worldwide according to established co ntracts for many years. Market studies are 
therefore not relevant to the purpose of this Te chnical Report. This section summarizes the key 
contracts. 
The copper concentrate produced at the Candel aria Copper Mining Complex has the following 
characteristics: the copper content varies between 27.0% to 33.0%, gold content varies from 4.0 g/t 
to 12.0 g/t and silver content vari es from 30 g/t to 125 g/t. There are certain areas of the ore body 
that contains zinc which can lead to Zn content in copper concentrate to be up to 3.75%. Aside from 
Zinc, the material has very low content of impur ities like lead, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and 
mercury. The concentrate moisture level is ty pically between 6.0-7.0% which is adequate for 
transportation and limits dust during handling.  
The quality produced at Candelaria / Ojos is mark etable worldwide. The low level of elements 
detrimental to copper smelting and refining makes the concentrate a valued quality for the feed mix 
for many smelters. The concentrate is shipped to the Far East (Japan, South Korea and China) and 
Europe.  
The copper concentrate production is predominantly sold under long term contracts directly to 
smelters and some traders. On a yearly basis , up to 15% of the annual copper concentrate 
production is sold on a spot basis through a tender process allowing for some production fluctuations. 
Franco-Nevada (Barbados) Corpor ation owns a gold and silver stream on production from the 
Candelaria operation. The stream covers 68% of  the payable gold and silver from 100% of the mine 
which reduces to 40% after 720,000 ounces of gold and 12 million ounces of silver have been 
delivered to Corporation (Franco-Nevada). As of December 31, 2022 CCMC has delivered 484.koz of gold and 7.8Moz of silver. Based on the 2023 LO M production estimates, the change from 68% to 
40% of production is expected to occur in year 2027. 
In addition to copper concentrate sales, there is an agreement with Compañía Minera del Pacifico 
S.A to process Candelaria's flotation tailings to  produce a magnetite concentrate and this proc
ess
cre
ates an additional source of by-product revenue subject to favourable iron ore prices.CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

Community Impact 
This section summarizes the environmental and soci al aspects of the Minera Candelaria and Minera 
Ojos del Salado operations and was compiled from information made available by LMC and a site 
visit by SRK on October 4 and 5, 2022. 
19.1 Environmental Studies and Regulatory Framework 
Chile h
as a comprehensive regulatory framework in  place governing both environmental approvals 
and associated construction and operating permits, generally referred to as Environmental Sectorial Permits ( Permisos Ambientales Sectoriales , or PAS). The Environmental Impact Evaluation System 
(Sistema de Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental , or SEIA) came into being in 1994 with the 
promulgation of Law 19.300. The implementing regul ations have been modified on more than one 
occasion since then as the system has evolved, most recently in 2013. The SEIA is administered by 
the Environmental Evaluation Service ( Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental , or SEA), an arm of the 
Environment Ministry ( Ministerio del Medio Ambiente , or MMA). 
Mining and other activities (with the notable exce ption of agriculture) in Chile are subject to 
environmental review and can be approved via three mechanisms, as follows: 
1.
A "Pertinencia de Ingreso" (or Pertinencia) is  a document prepared for small projects  or
minor mo
difications to existing projects, which demonstrates that the effects of the prop osed
action a
re below the threshold requiring formal environmental review. Once approve d by the
SEA the project or modification can procee d without undergoi
ng environmental revi ew
(althou
gh sectorial permits, or modifications to existing permits, may be required) .
2.
An Environmental Impact Declaration ( Declaración de Impacto Ambiental , or DIA) is requi red
to be submitt
ed by the proponent for projects or project modifications that are significa nt
enou
gh to warrant environmental review, but which are not expected to result in signifi cant
envi
ronmental impacts, as these are defined legally.
3.
An Environmental Impact Study ( Estudio de Impacto Ambiental , or EIA) is requi red to be
submitted b
y the proponent for projects or project modifications where significant
environmental impacts are expected to occu r, and where specific measures for impact
avoi
dance, mitigation or compensa tion will need to be agreed upon.
The SEA approves 
DIAs and EIAs following regulatory re view and (in the case of EIAs) formal public 
consultation, by issuing an Environmental Qualification Resolution ( Resolución de Calificación 
Ambiental , RCA). RCAs can run to several hundred pages in length for complex projects, and 
usually, contain numerous conditions of approval rela ted to both environmental and social aspects of 
project development, that must be adhered to by  the project proponent during all phases of the 
project life cycle. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 140 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 Normally, once a proponent obtains an RCA it is  necessary to obtain sectorial permits for 
construction and operation of the new or modi fied project. These are described further in 
Section 19.2.2.  
19.2 Permitting and Compliance 
19.2.1 Environmental Approvals 
Minera Candelaria 
The orig inal Candelaria projec t was submitted to a voluntary enviro nmental ass essment process  and 
was approved by resolution ORD No. 817 on J une 9, 1992. The Candelaria mine officially started 
operations on March 9, 1995 and has undergone a series of modific ations since the early 1990s, 
which have been permitted through Pertinencias, DIAs, and EIAs (Table 46 and Table 47). 
The most recent major environmental permitti ng effort was the "Candelaria 203 0" EIA which 
included, among other things, an extension to t he mine life and the development of the Los Diques 
tailings storage facility. The SEA approved the EIA v ia RCA No. 133/ in July 2015. Construction of 
the initial phases of Los Diques tailings stora ge facility is  now complete and the facility is operational. 
Candelaria is in the process of review and app roval of EIA 2040. The EIA docum ents were submitted 
to the SEIA (Environmental Impac t Assess ment Sy stem, acrony m in Spanish) in Febru ary 2020 and 
have gone through various stages of consultation s with the Chilean authority. Currently, Minera 
Candelaria is preparing a response for " Informe Consolidado de Aclaraciones, Rectificaciones o 
Ampliaciones ( ICSARA) 3" whi ch will be s ubmitted in Q2-2 023. Approval of the new EIA is expected 
in late 2023 or earl y 2024 and has been used as the basis of the 2023 Life of Mine (LOM) plan. The 
new EIA will allow CCMC to continue its operations to 2040.

19.2.2 Sectorial Permits 
Environmental sectorial permits 
(Permisos Ambientales Sectoriales , or PAS) authorizing the 
construction and operation of new or modified facilities must be obtained following environmental 
approval. These permits are granted by as many as ten different public agencies including the Water 
Board ( Dirección General de Aguas , or DGA), the National Geology and Mining Service ( Servicio 
Nacional de Geología y Minería , SERNAGEOMIN) and the Health Ministry ( Ministerio de Salud ). 
Minera Candelaria 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex has a ll required permits in place and, through its 
Environmental Management System keeps a detailed record of each permit and its compliance 
status. Since 1992, approximately 1,157 specific sectorial permits have been obtained. 
During the Candelaria 2030 environmental permitting process 150 sectorial permits were identified, 
mostly related to the development of the Los Di ques tailings storage fac ilities. The two most 
important construction permits for Los Diques we re granted by the SERNAGEOMIN in July 2016 and 
by the DGA in August 2016. Construction of the embankment was completed on schedule and the 
operating permit were granted by the DGA in August 2018. 
The Technical Permit from SERNAGEOMIN for the Port and Plant Operations was granted in 
December 2017. In addition, the Candelaria 2030 Closure Plan was approved in September 2018. 
Minera Ojos del Salado 
The Minera Ojos del Salado operations are associated with approximately 296 specific sectorial 
permits. As with Minera Candelaria, detailed records of all permits and their compliance status are 
maintained.  
19.2.3 Environmental Compliance 
The environm
ental appro vals and PAS associated with Candelar ia and Ojos del Salado include a 
total of approximately 3,000 conditions of approval . Candelaria uses a software system called SIGEA 
to catalogue these conditions and to verify compliance with all of them. In addition, internal and 
external audits are conducted to verify compliance with applicable legal requirements, and the 
operations are subject to frequent regulatory inspections as well. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 143 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 The following sections describe previous and open legal cases related to the environmental issues. 
SMA Charges 
The SMA is the arm of the Environment Ministry that is responsible for monitoring and enforcing 
compliance with environmental approval (RCA) conditions and applicable environmental legal 
requirements. In 2013 and 2014, prior to LMC's acquis ition of its interest in the mine, the SMA 
conducted two inspections of the Candelaria mine  and port facilities. In May 2015, the SMA issued 
Extent Resolution No. 1/ROL D-018-2015 detailing 16 charges against the Candelaria Copper 
Mining Complex for alleged non-complianc e with its environmental approvals. 
Following approximately 18 months of informatio n exchange, the SMA issued Extent Resolution 
No. 1111/2016 in December 2016. With this resolution, the SMA eliminated four of the 16 charges, and levied a fine totaling 5,049 annual tax units (UTA ), equivalent to approximately US$4M. From 
the total fine amount, approximately 90% was linked to a single charge related to the allegation that the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex did not reduce groundwater consumption sufficiently to 
reflect the increasing rate of recirculation from t he tailings storage facility and the additional supply of 
treated domestic wastewater from Aguas Chañar and desalinated seawater. 
Candelaria appealed the sanctioning resolution to the Environmental Court. In June 2018 Candelaria 
was notified of the rejection of the appeal in the Environmental Court and in July 2018, Candelaria 
paid the fine and appealed to the Supreme Court (Corte Suprema). The Supreme Court overturned the ruling, and the case was revisited by t he Environmental Court. In November 2021, the 
Environmental Court overturned the SMA fine (i.e ., overextraction of groundwater) and ordered the 
SMA to carry out a new investigation. SMA appealed to the Court through a cassation legal process 
in December 2020. The Supreme Court ruling accepted SMA's appeal and ratified the fines to 
Candelaria in the charges associated wi th water (Role 4.308-2021) on June 22, 2022. 
SMA Case-Blasting.  On July 23, 2021, the SMA notified Mi nera Candelaria six (6) charges related 
to alleged breaches to Candelaria RCAs. The charges are the following: On July 24, 2018, Candelaria received 11 l/s over the daily average flow allowed to be supplied from the Aguas Chañar 
Plant; In 2016, Candelaria built an emergency pool with a capacity of 1,310 m
3 which exceeded 
26.2% of the approved capacity; in some periods  of 2018, 2019 and 2020, Candelaria used more 
than the 90 tons/day limit of explosives authorized in the RCA to carry out each blasting event; and on five (5) occasions during 2019 and 2020, Ca ndelaria exceeded the number of authorized daily 
blasting events; in 2020, Candelaria used receptor  points different than those described in the RCA 
for vibration monitoring; in some periods of 2018, 2019 and 2020, Candelaria did not report the 
industrial waste discharges per set in its Monitoring Program. 
The SMA considers charges N°1, N°3 and N°4 as serious. A serious offense may imply, per the 
provisions of art. 38 of Law 20,417, the revocation of the RCA, closure, or a fine of up to 5,000 UTA (US $ 2.2M for each charge, app). It is considered highly unlikely the final sanction would be the 
closure of the mine or the revocation of the approval. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 144 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 SMA Case-Sinkhole. On July 30, 2022, a sinkhole 48 metres in diameter and 64 metres deep 
occurred on property belonging to Compañía Minera Contractual Ojos del Salado. Immediate safety 
measures were taken, and investigation work was initiated by both the authority and the Company, 
which is still in progress. On October 6, 2022, the SMA served the Compañia Contractual Minera 
Ojos del Salado (CCMO), the owner of the Alca parrosa mine (CCMO), with an infraction notice 
alleging four breaches of CCMO's environmental perm it. The allegations include (i) overextraction of 
ore in 2019; (ii) unpermitted modification of mine in frastructure impacting the aquifer (which includes 
piercing the aquifer); (iii) non-compliance with permitted conditions regarding maximum truck 
tonnage; and (iv) the unpermitted movement of an ore reception point. If convicted, it can mean the 
revocation of the RCA, closure, or maximum fines  of up to US$10-15M. CCMO is considering its 
options and strategies for addressing the infraction notice. In providing the notice, the SMA also 
press released that it had ordered the closure of the Gaby stopes – which the CCMO had already 
sterilized as a result of the plugging of those stopes. 
In addition to the SMA infractions, SERNAGEOM IN requested the temporary stoppage of the 
Alcaparrosa mine and DGA has imposed a fine to  CCMO of about US$140,000 (maximum fine) 
stating that the operation of the Alcaparrosa mine has caused the perforation of the Copiapó aquifer 
causing permanent damage. CCMO expects additi onal regulatory, administrative (CDE) and 
civil/constitutional claims (Tierra Amarilla, local re sidents, other aquifer users, etc.) are likely to be 
forthcoming in the months/years a head. Further, the Comp any anticipates that it will be required to 
remediate the damage to the aquifer and, eventually, fill the sinkhole. 
The sinkhole issue has generated a significant  commotion in the area and has affected the 
Company's reputation and relationship with the communities and also with the authorities. The 
Company's future actions will be oriented towards the develop of the necessa ry actions to mitigate 
and compensate for the damage caused, prevent future  related issues, and to regain the trust of the 
community and authorities. In November 2022, t he Company launched the Integrated Plan for the 
Alcaparrosa mine, outlining six focus areas to address the environmental and social impacts 
generated by the sinkhole. The plan's scope broadly invo lves the filling of the sinkhole, stabilizing the 
stopes, managing water infiltration and sealing the aquifer permeation, and expelling excess water 
accumulated in the mine, and managing stakeholder relations, legal processes and permit 
applications, with a budget of $22.5M. 
19.3 Environmental Management 
The CCM
C operations are located in the lower port ion of the El Bronce and El Buitre sub-basins. 
Both sub-basins are oriented east-west and drain towards the Copiapó River. 
The CCMC is located near the town of Tierra Amarilla and near an agriculture area of the Copiapó 
valley. In this region mining activities coexis t with communities and agricultural activities. The 
Copiapó River Basin has significant shortages of groundwater resources and aquifer levels have 
decreased over time due to water extraction for agricultural, industrial and domestic uses. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 145 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 The Copiapó valley is located in the southern margin s of the Atacama Desert and is characterized by 
an arid climate. The Tierra Amarilla area has an average annual temperature of 17 degrees Celsius, 
an average relative humidity of 60% and an annual average precipitation of  17 millimetres. In the 
coastal area, Caldera has an average annual temperat ure of 15 degrees Celsius, an average relative 
humidity of 82% and annual average precipitation of 6 millimetres. Rainfall is irregular from year to 
year and several years typically pass between significant precipitations events, which are often 
associated with the El Niño phenomenon. 
As seen in previous paragraphs, the envir onmental management for the CCMC is strongly 
influenced by climate and regional drainages. 
19.3.1 Key Environmental Issues 
The ke
y environmental management issues at the Ca ndelaria Copper Mining Complex are related to 
the specific sensitivities of the region, as summarized in the following sections. 
Water Supply 
Taking into consideration the sens itivities of water resources in the Copiapó basin, the Candelaria 
Copper Mining Complex has developed and implemen ted a water resource optimization plan for its 
operations. Since 2013, the operations have elimi nated groundwater use for processing activities. 
The main sources of water are now derived from recirculation of water from the tailings storage 
facilities and desalinated seawater pumped from the desalination plant located adjacent to the 
marine terminal at Caldera. Water from groundwater wells remains available for use in case of 
emergency and maintenance of the desalination plant. 
One of the conditions of approval of the Candelaria  2030 EIA is the gradual phase-out of the use of 
water from the Aguas Chañar wastewater treat ment plant by July 2025. Since July 2019 the 
commitment has been fulfilled because the cont ract with Aguas Chañar was terminated.  
Water Quality 
Water quality management and control of potential wate r loss from the mining facilities are important 
issues addressed through the environment al management of the operations. 
The inactive Candelaria tailings storage facility and the new Los Diques tailings storage facility have 
been designed to minimize water losses and maximize water reuse in the processing plant. 
For the Los Diques tailings storage facility, hydrog eological studies indicate that seepage flows are 
low and flow towards the cu rrent open pit mine, which will act as a sink. Preferential infiltration flows 
occur toward the pit, at depths greater than 500 me tres below surface, deeper than the depth of the 
Copiapó aquifer in the area, which is located at depths between 40 and 120 metres. Generally, both waste rock and tailings at Candelar ia exhibit a low potential for acid rock drainage 
and the arid climate results in conditions whereby t he amount of rainwater coming into contact with 
tailings and waste rock is minimal. Hence the long-term risk of acid rock drainage and associated 
impacts to surface and/or groundwater quality is considered very low. Despite this, the authorities CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 146 
SRK Team February 22, 2023 raised concerns during the review of the Can delaria 2030 EIA about potential seepage from the 
tailings storage facilities and any associated impact s on the Copiapó River basin. As a result, one of 
the approval conditions of RCA 133/2015 is that, if water is present in any of the wells of the Los 
Bronces drainage (P1 and PP2 monitoring wells1), the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex must 
proceed immediately with the hydrogeological isolation of the Los Bronces sub-basin from the 
Copiapó area aquifer system, by a mechanism that will require approval from the environmental 
authorities. According to monitoring data, these wells have not registered any water. 
Air Quality 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex operates close to populated areas where agriculture is a 
significant land use along with several other mining operations. Air quality, notably fugitive dust from 
mining, transportation and other activities, is a relevant environmental issue. In their comments on 
the Candelaria 2030 EIA, the authorities pointed out  that the area is technically saturated for 
respirable particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). Fo llowing a regional review in 2021, the authorities 
determination that parts of Tierra Amarilla and Copi apó are saturated areas in terms of dust was 
published in the Official Gazette (Decree N° 15/2021 Environmental Ministry and the Resolution N°33 (January 21, 2022). The Environmental Author ity are working with mine and smelter operators 
in the region to agree with the Decontamination Plan.  
In this context, the Candelaria Copper Mining Comple x utilizes a series of measures to control dust 
emissions, including a road wetting plan, nebulizer s on stockpiles, crusher dust collectors, and 
internal monitoring of emission control. The appro val of the Candelaria 2030 EIA required additional 
dust mitigation measures, which are being im plemented in accordance with the RCA. 
Candelaria has implemented an online climate and air quality monitoring network with cameras to 
monitor environmental conditions in Caldera a nd Copiapó Valley. These monitoring systems give 
operational alerts of environmental conditions an d establish relationships between the operations 
emissions and the conditions in the valley. 
With the declaration of a saturated area, in the evaluation of the Candelaria  2040 EIA, the authority 
requested the reinforcement of dust measur es and proposed compensation measures. 
Environmental Monitoring Program 
Since 1993 an environmental monitoring program has been in place to identify any changes in 
environmental conditions with respect to the baseli ne dataset. The results are periodically sent to the 
responsible government authorities. The monitoring program includes groundwater quality and levels, dust, noise and vibration, and marine parameters, among others. The approval of the 
Candelaria 2030 project (RCA N°133/2015) adde d additional monitoring requirements which are 
being implemented. A summary of the current m onitoring program is tabulated in Table 50.

developed and implemented a plan to comply with the commitments of the Candelaria 2030 approval 
resolution, including maintaining relevant record s and reporting to the responsible government 
authorities in the required timelines.

Since 2018, the CCMC has implemented LM C's Responsible Mining Management Standard 
(RMMS), updated in 2022 to provide an integrat ed Health, Safety, Environment and Communities 
(HSEC) management system aligned with  the LMC Sustainability Strategy. 
 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex implemented the updated standard ISO 14001/2015 for Minera 
Candelaria and Minera Ojos de Salado. An external audit was performed in January 2021 and the certification was subsequently  granted for three years. 
 
In 2021 Candelaria also implemented an Energy  Management System (Standard ISO 50.001). An 
external audit was performed in April 2021 and the certification was subsequently granted for three 
years. 
 
19.3.2 Mine Closure Planning 
 CCMC has developed a closure plan for each of the Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado 
operations in accordance with applicable legal requirements, specifically Law 20.551/2011 and 
Supreme Decree N°41/2012, in addition to LMC corporate mine closure planning standard. The 
competent authority for approving Mine Closure Plans (MCPs) in Chile is SERNAGEOMIN. Under 
current law, mining projects with an extraction capacity of over 10,000 tonnes per month must 
provide a financial guarantee, the amount of wh ich will be determined based on the periodic re-
evaluation of the closure plan im plementation and management costs. 
 
SERNAGEOMIN approved the MCP for Candelaria  in September 2018. The MCP addresses the 
changes to the project documented in the 2030 EIA, in cluding the Los Diques tailings storage facility. 
The approved closure cost estimate for Minera Candelaria is: 
 
 Total cost 4.2M Unidades de Fomento (UF) (approximately US$153M), comprising direct 
closure costs of UF 3.7M (a pproximately US$133M), and post-closure costs of UF 0.6M 
(approximately US$20M). 
 Minera Candelaria is in the process of pr oviding the required guarantees for the approved 
closure plan. Until year 2022 Candelaria has provided guarantee for the 49% of the present 
value of closure costs. 
 
SERNAGEOMIN approved the Minera Ojos del Salado MC P in 2018. Estimated closure costs at that 
time were UF 0.3M (approximately US$8M).  
 
The closure plan for San Esteban I and II, two l egacy tailing facilities, was approved and fully 
executed. Candelaria received the final certific ate of closure for these facilities in 2020.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 19.4 Social and Community Issues 
 
Tierra Amarilla is the community closest to the C andelaria Copper Mining Complex. This proximity 
can result in potential impacts of noise, dust, visual  intrusion, blasting, and vehicular traffic. The 
concentrate storage shed, port terminal and desalination plant are located near the community of 
Caldera. Linear infrastructure and activities including power lines, water pipelines and concentrate 
transport are in the vicinity of smaller towns and tran sverse 110 kilometres from mine site to the port. 
 
Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del Salado ar e subject to the requirements of the Chilean 
regulatory process and must also meet the co rporate requirements set by LMC related to 
stakeholder engagement, impact management, and social investment.  
LMC is committed to fostering healthy, resilient, and diversified communities in its areas of operation. 
To achieve this, the Company places priority on proactive and transparent engagement processes 
that lead to collaboration with stakeholders whic h in turn enables the Company to appropriately 
respond to their concerns. 
 
The Company has developed a consistent and holistic five-year Corporate Social Performance Strategy anchored on strengthening internal sk ills and competencies, enhancing data-driven 
decision making, integrating social performance into enterprise-wide strategy and advancing 
development of social initiatives and targets. 
 
LMC's RMMS and its associated Social Performanc e Standards are the foundational tools that help 
implement the five-year Corporate Social Performance Strategy and drive appropriate impact 
management, engagement and community investment at our sites. As part of these Standards, the 
operations are required to develop site-specific five -year Social Performance Strategies that outline 
their main objectives for engagement, investment, and local content. The Company then requires sites to develop Annual Plans to execute on the strategy. 
 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex produced its first five-year Social Performance Strategy in 
2018. In 2022, CCMC updated its Annual Social Perfor mance Plan to reflect the new socio-economic 
context triggered by the pandemic, the social unrest experienced in the country and lingering 
challenges in the relationship with Tierra Amarilla due to the impacts of dust and vibration, as well as 
the need to enhance local economic development. The revised plan centered on enhancing impact mitigation efforts through more extensive an d proactive engagement and the expansion of 
participatory monitoring activities that build capaci ty and awareness in the community. The plan also 
prioritized reigniting direct collaboration with nei ghborhoods and community organizations mainly in 
Tierra Amarilla and Caldera to plan and execute community investment projects.  
 
In 2021, LMC launched the Social Licence to Operate Index (SLO index) at all its operations to 
measure community trust and acceptance levels and identify drivers that can enhance or hinder trust 
so as to inform their engagement, social investment, and operational activities. To date, Candelaria 
has completed three surveys since late 2021, effect ively collecting over 1300 responses across its 
area of influence. CCMC plans to conduct quarterly pulse surveys to monitor its progress. This tool, CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 150 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 considered one of the main community engagement channels, has proven effective in improving the 
Company's responsiveness to community concerns and needs. 
 
CCMC operates community liaison offices in Tierra Amarilla, Copiapó and Caldera to enhance 
stakeholders' access to information about the Co mpany, facilitate skills training workshops and 
provide access to computers and internet to the population. Visits to the offices remain a key 
engagement channel for the Company. CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

20 Capital and Operating Costs 
 
20.1 Operating Costs 
 
The summary operating costs per tonne forecasted for Minera Candelaria and Minera Ojos del 
Salado are tabulated in Table 51. 
 Candelaria costs have increased compared to the previous years as a result of inflation (CPI and 
commodity prices), increased external services, repair supplies and mining equipment lease 
expenses. This is partially offset  by a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Unit costs are expected 
to decrease in the coming years, mainly as a resu lt of lower diesel prices from 2023 (as the new 
electricity contract comes into effect) and a reduction in mining equipment leasing expenses. 
 
Minera Ojos del Salado unit operating costs have also in creased as a result of inflation, also partially 
offset by the favorable exchange rate. LOM 2023 costs reflect the impact of the suspension of 
Alcaparrosa mining activities from 2023.

The following sections present a breakdown of the mining, processing, and general and 
administrative operating costs. 
 
20.1.1 Mining Operating Costs 
 
Table 52 presents a breakdown of the forecast Candelaria Open Pit mining costs. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 152 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The average open pit mining cost over the next five years, excluding capitaliz ed waste stripping, is 
forecast at US$2.50 per tonne of material moved. Costs have increased over previous estimates due 
to inflation and additional mining equipment leasing expenses in years 2023 and 2024. 
 
Annual fluctuations in unit costs are also the resu lt of components replacement from the cycle repair 
program, mainly in shovel fleets. The cost per tonne of material moved is forecast to decrease from 
2024 as result of lower diesel and explosives pr ices. Stripping operations for the "La Española" open 
pit will start in  January 2024. 
 
The volume of ore re-handled from the stockpile w ill increase to replace th roughput redu ction from 
the underground mine due to suspension of the Alca parrosa mine. Costs will decrease towards the 
end of the mine life, with the reduction of waste st ripping operations and increase in stockpile ore re-
handling.

Table 52 also tabulates the amount of waste strippi ng costs transferred to capital expenditures. LMC 
capitalizes waste stripping costs when actual strip ratios are above the average planned strip ratio 
for each open pit phase under development. Total capitalized waste stripping costs have increased 
from previous forecasts as a result of hi gher mining costs over the next five years. 
 
The operating costs forecasted for the Candelar ia Underground mine operati ons are presented in 
Table 53. The average cost over the next five ye ars is forecast at US$16. 05 per tonne. Costs are 
expected to decrease towards the end of the mi ne life as mine development requirements reduce.

The average cost forecasted for PAC plant over t he next five years is US$10.67 per tonne. PAC 
plant is considerably smaller than Candelaria plan t, and therefore the average cost per tonne is more 
than twice as high. Costs are forecast to decre ase from 2023 because of lower energy costs, as 
noted above.

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 LMC capitalizes waste stripping costs when experie nced strip ratios are above the average planned 
strip ratio for each open pit phase under devel opment. During the production phase of the 
Candelaria Open Pit, waste stripping costs, whic h provide probable future economic benefits and 
improved access to the orebody are capitalized to  mineral properties. Capitalized waste stripping 
from the open pit is forecasted at US$578M for the period 2023 to 2027 and US$1,066M over the life 
of mine. 
 Capital expenditure estimates for Minera Ojos del Salado over the next 5 years total US$61 million, 
and from 2028 to 2046, US$20M, resulting in a total of US$81M over the life of mine, as can be seen 
in Table 60. This is an increase from previous fo recasts and reflects the capitalization of mine access 
development in waste and the extensi on of Santos mine life to 2034.

24 Interpretation and Conclusions 
The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is a signifi cant, long-life, copper mining operation. In 2023, 
the complex is expected to produce contained metal in concentrate (100% basis) of 145-155 kilotonnes of copper and 85,000-90,000 ounce s of gold. Based on the December 31, 2022 
Mineral Reserves, the CCMC is expected to support operations until 2046. 
 
Since LMC purchased the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex in late 2014 to the end of June 2022, 
there has been an investment in exploration of  approximately US$177M. During this period 2,336 
core bore holes (678,070 metres) were drilled requiring over 4,000 metres of underground 
development. 
 
Aggressive ongoing Mineral Resource expansion exploration since acquisition may have the potential to extend the mine life beyond 2046 and to further change the projected copper production 
profile by replacing low grade open pit and deferring stockpile mill feed with higher grade ore 
extracted from the expanding underground mi nes and deferring deplet ion of the low-grade 
stockpiles. There are also opportunities to optimize the efficiency of the Candelaria processing plant 
through ongoing improvement initiatives currentl y under implementation and modifications to the 
grinding circuits. Various ongoing onsite innovation / optimization initiatives with certain disciplines 
(including MIRA, CMOP, Candelaria South deve lopment, mining equipment upgrades and various 
infrastructure upgrades) are progressing well, with  each having the potential to have a positive and 
material impact on operational efficiencies and to the life of mine. 
 
A team of independent consultants returned to the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex during 
October 2022 to review changes to the assets since undertaking a similar review in the fourth quarter 
of 2018. Although currently experiencing re-organiza tion with several new team members recently 
joined The Company, technical information about t he CCMC is extensive and attests to the overall 
high quality of the exploration, mine planning,  and design work completed by site personnel. 
Although Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve growth through exploration success has decreased in recent years, operational effici encies, a reduction in reporting cut-off grades, continued Mineral 
Resource model integrations and the incorporation of material from the expanding Española open pit 
project have made significant contributions to mine growth. 
 
The authors of this Technical Report have exam ined the exploration, geology, Mineral Resource 
modelling, mine designs, Mineral Reserve estimate s, processing, and envir onmental aspects of the 
Candelaria Copper Mining Complex. The purpose of t he investigation was to confirm that the Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates prepare d by mine personnel were prepared in compliance 
with generally recognized industry best practices and can be reported according to Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves  (May 2014). 
 
The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are distributed in one open pit mine, one open pit 
project and two separate underground mines. SRK a udited representative do mains of the various CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation

SRK Team   February 22, 2023 block models and mine designs. For those models,  SRK was able to replicate the tabulations 
prepared by mine personnel within rounding errors. Based on the results from the 2022 audit 
combined with knowledge from previous audits, the qualified persons concludes that the Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Statements for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex effective 
as of December 31, 2022, are appropriately cat egorized and free of material errors. Financial 
information examined during the SRK investigations confirm that the Mineral Reserves are economic 
under the assumptions considered.  
The authors of this Technical Repo rt draw the following conclusions: 
 
 The Candelaria Copper Mining Complex is a significant mining, long-life, operation. 
 In addition to underground Mineral Resource expansion, surface exploration has also 
successfully delineated deposits amenable to open pit extraction in the Candelaria district. 
 A robust Mineral Resource modelling methodology established in recent years continues to 
provide a sound basis for Mineral Resource reporting and subsequent mine planning. 
 The life of mine plan now forecasts depletion of  Mineral Reserves in 2046, with the potential 
to further increase this in the future. 
 Mineral Reserves are estimated using a cop per price of US$3.35 per pound, a gold price of 
US$1,600 per ounce and a silver price of US$22.00 per ounce. 
 The Los Diques tailings storage facility which was commissioned during the first quarter of 
2018 is fully operational and can now receive 100% of the flotation tailings from the 
Candelaria processing plant. A tailings pipeline from the PAC plant to the Los Diques TSF 
was completed in 2020. 
 The mines have a customized st ate of the art export port fa cility at Punta Padrones with 
significant excess capacity. 
 Exploration success during 2014 to 2022 has defined new Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves in the underground mines, significant ly extending their lives. Further exploration 
success has the potential to extend their lives  further and potentially allow increasing their 
throughput. This will improve the copper produ ction profile by replacing low-grade open pit 
and stockpile mill feed with higher-grade undergr ound ore and may defer stockpile depletion. 
 Additional drilling at Española has significantly  increased reported Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves for this project. 
 Although reduced compared to previous periods , the proposed five-year exploration program 
(US$48.00M from 2023 to 2027) may continue to add Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves, if implemented. 
 Recent regional exploration in other parts of  the Candelaria district has identified several 
other exploration targets, with good potential for identifying new IOCG sulphide deposits in 
this exceptional IOCG deposit district. 
 Exploration has been instrumental in extendi ng the life of the Candelaria Copper Mining 
Complex to at least 2046. 
 Although mineralized material from the Al caparrosa mine has been excluded from the 
current Mineral Reserves, it should be able  to again contribute to CCMC's future mine 
planning once the SMA infraction notices have been addressed. 
 The following summarizes the areas of uncert ainty and risk associated with the Candelaria 
Copper Mining Complex: CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 163 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023  Minera Candelaria is in the process of review and approval of EIA 2040. The EIA 
documents were submitted to the SEIA in  February 2020. The 2040 EIA has been 
through three rounds of review and Minera Candelaria is in the process of preparing its 
responses through a third Addenda and expect s a final determination in late 2023 or 
early 2024. The EIA will allow CCMC to continue its operations to 2040. 
 In July 2018, Minera Candelaria paid a fine (5,049 annual tax units, equivalent to 
approximately US$4M) and appealed to the S upreme Court. After an intervention by the 
Environmental Court, the Supreme Court ratified the fines to Minera Candelaria. 
 In July 2021, the SMA notified Minera Candelaria of six charges to Candelaria RCAs. 
Three of these charges are considered serious by the SMA with a potential fine of up to 
5,000 annual tax units (US$2.2M) for each charge. 
 As a result of the July 30, 2022, sinkhole event, Minera Ojos del Salado was issued with 
an infraction notice by the SMA alleging four  breaches of CCMO's environmental permit. 
According to the SMA, the potential fines can be up to $15M. In addition, 
SERNAGEOMIN requested the temporary st oppage of the Alcaparrosa mine and the 
DGA has imposed a fine on Minera Ojos del Salado of about US$140K. 
 CCMC's future actions should be oriented towards the development of the necessary 
actions to mitigate and compensate for the damage potentially caused by the sinkhole 
that appeared near the Alcaparrosa mine in July 2022, prevent future related issues, and 
to regain the trust of the community and authorities. 
 
Other than what has been disclosed in this Tec hnical Report, the authors of this Technical Report 
are not aware of any other significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to 
affect the reliability or confidence in the Mineral  Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates prepared 
for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex. 
 
25 Recommendations 
The CCMC comprises several operating copper mines with a combined life of mine projected to 
2046 with the depletion of the Mineral Reserve esti mates disclosed herein. Since 2010, innovative 
and aggressive exploration has defined several new sulphide mineralization zones amenable to 
underground and surface mining. These significant  discoveries together with ongoing mine 
optimization studies have a positive impact on the life and value of the CCMC by primarily replacing 
low-grade open pit and stockpile plant feed with hi gher-grade underground ore, thereby deferring 
processing low grade work-in-progress stockpiles to a later date. 
 
The increase in underground Mineral Reserves has had a positive impact on the life of the 
underground mines. LMC should continue with t he optimization studies initiated in 2016 to 
investigate expansion options for the underground mi nes, re-optimization of the Candelaria open pit 
mine, and to increase the efficiency the main Candelaria process plant. 
 
The mineral resource qualified person recommends reviewing the factors im pacting the conversion 
of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves with an objective to increase the conversion ratio. 
 CAPR002061 – Lundin Mining Corporation 
Technical Report for the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex, Chile Page 164 
 
 
SRK Team   February 22, 2023 The copper recovery model used by CCMC has not been updated for a number of years and since 
2020, the model estimates are deviating from actual plant results. It is the qualified person's opinion 
the CCMC recovery model be reviewed and updated to reflect recent plant performance and 
potentially the greater amount of stockpiled materi al being processed. (Currently, all stockpiled 
material is applied the same, discounted recoveries.) Factors such as zinc grade and stockpile 
ageing may have a greater effect on copper recovery compared to when the model was originally 
developed.  
It is the processing qualified person's opinion that  CCMC can improve their recovery and concentrate 
grade forecasting models, based on recent plant operating data. 
 
The authors of this Technical Report strongly re commend that LMC continue its effective exploration 
strategy that has been very successful in in creasing the Mineral Resources and the Mineral 
Reserves of the CCMC, with a renewed focus on regi onal exploration targets external to the current 
LOM footprint. 
 
Minera Candelaria should continue to actively work with SEIA to facilitate the approval of EIA 2040 to 
support the production schedule presented in th is Technical Report and obtain the operational 
permits required to develop t he new areas of Mineral Reserv es and ancillary facilities.
